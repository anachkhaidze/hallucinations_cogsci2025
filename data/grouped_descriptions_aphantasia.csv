mostly a honeycomb of red and black - very blurred and moving, slowly shifting.
sometimes it went to mostly red in one area and that could slide around 1) A pattern of hexagons that were touching each other but not overlapping.
2) Thick horizontal and vertical lines with fuzzy edges that intersected at the center of my field of view.  It would move if I looked at different parts of my 42"" monitor. I saw red, black and white. I saw a bunch of shapes like squares, circles, lines. The images were flickering very quickly so it's hard for me to recall exactly what they were. They would flicker for not even a second and then they would change. I saw several shapes on the screen during each quick flicker. Every flicker had different shapes/lines/grids, etc.  The flickering screen red and black and after a short time.. 30 sec to a min maybe? Hard to say... I noticed faint variations in the shades of red and black. Not really other colors but more like hues or red and black at different constantly changing / flashing spots on the screen that gave the impression of seeing faint shapes or balls of a brighter hue than the background, random patterns. It reminded me of looking at an optical illusion image (the grid illusion) where you can see fleeting black circles in the corners of the grid even though there are none. My peripheral vision was activating and showing me spinning red circles, or a red circle in the very center, but only during the flash and they would instantly change or disappear. If I looked up or down slightly, I could see bars of red on the top or bottom of the screen, same for left and right, and I would see no circles or illusion in the center. If I looked in the center of the screen, I would see a bright red circle, surrounded by flashing black/red circles moving around it in a circular fashion (all around the center point). These images would not persist and I could not focus on them. If I tried to focus on any of the illusionary circles, they would disappear. Often, the screen would once again seem to simply show red and black flickers across the entire screen. I did not see any recognizable complex images such as buildings, scenery, faces, animals, movie scenes, or anything else. I do not believe that I was experiencing imagination, just optical illusions. It was not an enjoyable experience, but I felt no overwhelming discomfort, else I would have stopped the experiment. I do not see anything differently now that I have completed the experiment. Just lots of different colors and geometric shapes/patterns. Like a kaleidoscope, but much more faint and ever changing. Mostly just different colors bouncing all around the screen in different shapes  clusters of bright small dots (anywhere from 3-10 at a time) Dark lines sometimes that would change sizes, widen and lengthen, a line that changed into a book that changed into a butterfly - it wasn't very vivid at all, but I could tell what it was, an alligator that had an open mouth that would move to the right appeared quite a lot after the 6 minute mark 3 times grid bigger blocks than computer keyboard 3D square tunnel-like thing on and off. Sort of a pulsating sensation to the field overall 42"" 4K monitor from about 24""... All shapes in circular pattern mostly circular, but some triangular ones with faint edges on all of them... in circular patterns alternating between circular and somewhat orthogonal grid... in concentric bands (like a pebble ripple in water I guess)...
I did not see the rhythm to be consistent... almost as having a start / stop effect and repeating that pattern.... also the red turned into an orange like color after a minute or 2.
The black ended up shifting between a greenish black and deep blue.
It gave in a headache nearly instantly after starting it... I have tinitus, so the white noise did not do anything... concentrating in the image made the sound fade away and the tinitus came in at a higher than normal volume in my head.
Weird experience to say the least. 5-7 minutes I saw purple dots that were circling around like stars in a galaxy, also with spiral arms etc. They were going quite fast, I wanted them to slow down (to imitate a galaxy) but they didn't. Then in the next few seconds the purple dots would form other shapes like waves or pillars that were turning as well. a bunch of pulsating black hexagons just blinking on and off with the screen. To clarify, I only saw them on the screen. no other hallucinations occurred.   a cross in the centre of the screen a few times over the whole ten minutes a crosshatch pattern, that was probably caused by the way my monitor refreshes the screen. Geometric moving spinning balls in spiral rotating patterns, sometimes like DNA, really beautiful. Multiple colors. Sometimes the entire screen went gray. I initial just saw a grid like image (something similar to a street in a map in bird's eye view). Then as every blink progressed, it multiplied until I eventually saw stars with just its outline.  There was no clear transition or whatsoever. Then it eventually had different formations, changing in time with the blinks while it was moving in accordance to where my eyes would go. It was something similar to the Paramount (I'm not sure if this is correct) logo's formation and movement of stars, actually, although it was just the outline of the stars. The outline was black while it was filled-in with the red background. Faint lines, sort-of circle-like sometimes, light movement of texture with the flashing, not any change in color other than deeper or lighter red. noticeably lighter and darker areas that caused the texture, slight movement with each flicker, no clear-cut images or shapes exactly, more like clouds and sometimes looks like ""light"" with lines or a circle Mostly lines, occasionally circles. Some of the circles seemed like they had some depth, like shading a 2d image to make an illusion. Some patterns that looked like starbursts or concentric rings, kind of like a hot-air balloon viewed from the top. Sometimes there were squiggly lines, they seemed to move back and forth with the change of color. A large black square in the center that was fuzzy and lasted a second or two, what seemed like a ping pong effect but no particular shape (more like light moving across the screen horizontally) that lasted about 5 seconds and re-occurred, and a bright green dot at the top right above the ganzflicker in my periphery. A few times it seemed like shapes were forming but they were gone very quickly. a lot of patterns. my brain attempted to make a butterfly but only in a geometric sense, not anything realistic. also it looked like the screen was bulging and wavy.  A lot of red that varied in color and intensity with what appeared to be stars in a galaxy that were blue and white A man running, a castle - maybe I read about it before hand, could be suggested rather than real a moving dot about 2 cms in diameter a pattern chifting and turning aroudn a potato that turned into an old man's face and then some alien scenery that was pulsing A slowly morphing pattern of dark and light shapes overlayed on the flicker.  Light green speckles were scattered in the darker areas, and were also relatively stable in position.  The shapes occasionally grouped to form a tunnel into the center of the screen, with spikes on the diagonals and concentric circles around the center.  Neither changing my gaze nor moving my head changed the location of the center of the effect.  At one point, a red speckle similar to laser speckle extended out a short distance from the edges of the screen. A sort of a merging of the red and the black screens. Some parts showed mostly red, some mostly black, with a averaged/""greyish""/""merged"" color on the border between the regions. A swirling blue/black pattern ""behind"" (i.e. seen through) the flashing screen. Vaguely reminiscent of both a rotating star field and oil on water. Quite similar to the patterns I see whenever I am in pitch darkness. A vague circular shape and a more rectangular shape below it, almost s silhouette of a person. Very blurred, and monotone - in a greenish colour, opposite to red. a vague shadow, once, that might have been a wolf face - I blame pareidolia if the black and red formed any sort of shape; the hint (and I mean, vaguest hint) of a skyline, just out of visual centre, I blame on shadows.
There were colours within the red and black - mostly green, hint of blue.  Followed the same flashes/ bursts as the red and black.   about one inch thick sort of black line, then a half circle some other stuff and squares inside of squares in green and pink All i saw was blue blobs across the flicker, occasionally i got a hit of green, but not enough to be sure. Very occasioannlly, i would see two orbiting 'whirl pool'/'black hole' type of objects, of almost insubsatial pattern. As soon as i tried to look at them or focus on them, they would dissappear. All I saw was geometric shapes and lines. I also saw a ball of light in the center with a kind of spider web shape surrounding it. After closing my eyes I was able to see a red colored dot for a brief moment. It was a light red very faded.  Almost as if watching your own pupil dilate. almost nothing, the flashing light visually seemed to slow and eventually I may have seen lines in the last couple of minutes. An eyeball and a strike of lightning An illusion that it was spinning, and moving around. Not sure if I'd even consider it images. An occassional cross in the centre if I focused there, followed by sensation of swirling movement (rotating clockwise). Unfocusing removed it then focusing made it return. Areas of reds and blue/black flickering Arora like patterns also almost robots? As the image flickered from red I saw an irregular pattern of lines with a gradient of color changing from red to turquoise in the spaces between the lines. Also, what seemed like semi regularly a black square would appear in the upper right corner and between the appearances of the black square a square in the same space would appear that was just a lighter shade of red than the rest of the screen. at first i saw an ""X"" then like two hands/palms, then spirals At first i saw what looked like a lot of people, then flower shapes, butterflies, large buildings and then it began to just look like a broken film reel trying to play with the flashing At first it seemed to change colors faster, then the screen began to appear as if it was shaking, and finally I saw the what looked like an eye staring at at me through the screen At first just red and black flickering, and the flicker was slow, gradually it become faster and geometric patterns would appear if ai had my vision centered and looking at one point. After a few minutes the flicker changed pattern/dimension you can say, it felt like more red was flickering and it started from the top othe screen, and then it was faster flicker with more black and more centered. But head and eyes staryed hurting and I turned it off at 9 minutes. At first there was sortof a heart briefly, then a lot of green spiderwebbing/lines for a long time, and finally it was more like the screen faded in color from red to black to red (or maybe vice versa).  When my screen shut off, I wasn't totally sure if the screen powered off or it was a new vision, but I figured it out, the screen timed out. At times (more so in the beginning), I saw vague diamondlike patterns equally spread over the whole screen.
When I blinked, there would appear to be a green tinge which was only momentary. at times all red, at times all black, at times green b l o b s Background white “nebula/cloud” as eyes saturate with red light…. ball moving or lines and triangles that would emerge hit a wall and bounce off. Much like the old microsoft windows screensaver where the microsoft logo would bounce off the frame. only in the colour of red,white and black. ball of orange light. color red sometime appears as if it was a light red or sometimes orange Balls or blobs, very weakly when I saw anything at all, but mostly just a flickering screen Besides red and black, I also saw brief flashes of magenta, blue and yellow. I noticed that the window appeared to be moving or changing size. I was reminded of the sensation of going from bright sunlight to dark indoors. There appeared to be ""static"" which is similar to what I see when I close my eyes. By not focusing on the screen, I was able to briefly see what looked like three dimensional movement going inward, like a ""wormhole"". I do not know if I actually saw it or just made a mental connection to how soap bubbles deform as they multiply. Black and red spots focused arount thr spot i was looking at. black balls and lines, a face like that of halloween white masks black grids in the middle of screen, moving follow the eye  black lines two to three inches long; tiny (pixel size) white dots scattered randomly about Black static that appeared to be vibrating and constantly morphed the same pattern didn't repeat  blotches shading towards yellow or green, like living tissue blue and red stars blue pink yellow flashes   but mostly a continuous pink flash.   small little things that were comprise of three black thin line that me in the center.  like a snow flake or wind mill as a comparison blue slashes crossing over the center then a dark blue and purple ball Briefly saw an X … everything else was just moving red and black Changes in how long between flashes, lots of squares, rotating checkerboard pattern, uniform shadows, yellow,  Checkerboard pattern, what looked like what you see in those images of the universe with ""dark matter"" between clumps of light/brightness circle and grid-like patterns, that moved focus when I moved my eyes. white hotspots in them - similar to a sparkler. tiny dots of other colours as part of the pattern (like, smaller than pixels, and so many that they almost made up other colours) Circle of beads circle patters, like  chains circles Circles, maybe an inch or two in diameter with dark edges Clearest was a honeycomb, lasting only a few seconds. Otherwise, it was just occasional flashes of lines and crosses. Not really strong enough I'd call them images, more like when you quickly look into a light and close your eyes, and you can still see a vague, undetailed afterimage. The flashing did seem to stop for a second (probably less) and it seemed like a solid red rectangle. Cloud like fuzzies that shifted during flickers.  Blue as primary color Green once.  Spinning to the right, once left.  Running like motion to the right. colorful, crayon line drawings of nothing in particular, different shapes, vague, faint colors - blue, green, yellow Colour flickering could kinda see red/black dragons moving up and down when I was focusing but it then became hard to focus on really fast. Cross hatched lines (red, black and white) that made wierd patterns. I have aphantasia but i still managed to get a small amount of control of what the lines looked like which was cool. Crosses and bar light patterns, no images of other things, just flashing red light Crosses, patterns, mostly straight lines (amiga/vga demo copperbar effects), colours other than red/black may have been green or purple. SOme ""lightning"" effects on colour borders sevral times, like a fractal effect. Dark circles at vision edges. Few dark spots here and there Dark circles in a grid pattern 3hx4w, flashing on and off at the same rate as the screen was flashing.  White spots flashing, like static on an old television. Definitely a red n black V depth and some darks shapes inside. Some yellow and purple dyscoloration diagonal fractals and ocasionally long lines diagonal greenish/yellowish faint lines diagonal scintillating lines, then some spirals -- colors that looked almost like a galaxy with a little bit of blue and pinpricks of light Didn't really see ""images."" They were more like little squiggles and shadow blurs Didnt really see anything except light flickering and sometimes it felt like the flickering was happening in grids or something diferent colored lights, like white and blue, the flickering seemed to be speeding up and then happening in like a rotation motion Different shapes composed of red and black, occasionally greenish yellow along the sides of the rectangle, sometimes sideways cones of white. I listened to white noise and I played with the volume as I watched and I noticed that any change (up or down) briefly increased the frequency/intensity of the flashing, but after a few seconds it plateaued out.  diffrent waves, spirels, gemetrical objects  Distorsions, nothing else dots and some geometric paterns shaping like there was a tunnel or something like that in my screen Dots of light and an ink blot like pattern  During the parts when the screen was predominantly red, I sometimes saw black horizontal lines moving from the bottom of the screen to the top and I once saw a black rectangle near the top.   E Early on I saw faded black lines kind of like webbing or grids from time to time, towards the end I saw vague distortions when my eyes shifted to different parts of the screen as if I were heading down tunnels.  All of these are very vague."

Immersive experience like I was inside the screen (brief moments) Faint flower-like spirals, and the impression of something rapidly bouncing back and forth faint lines, crosses and balls of light, adjusting my focus could make it seem like travelling forwards or backwards Faint sense of illusory rotation around centre of visual field visible only as fluctuations in the colour saturation; some blue and green coarse static; loss of saturation of the red background (faded towards grey) field of vision turning bright grey with occasional disappearance of the flashing altogether, along with appearance of black circles in centre of vision. first it was a bit like floaters all around, then started to see a cross in the middle where I looked, which appeared and disappeared regularly, also changing from + cross to x cross. Also seemed like there is green/blue color in addition to red. First was like a butterfly outline with neon lines, then it was mostly seeing circular motion in the effect or the picture becoming a square rather than the rectangle it really was. Also saw some weird images, like a bird flying but on really old damaged film. First, a kind of purple web (kind of universe representation showing galaxy clusters, these in purple), and later on a big black rectangle movig in the center (like in old computer screensavers) Fish Scale pattern, Spinning Circle flashes Flashing 2D squares of different colors. Mostly Red, Blue and Green. flashing black became triangular Flashing bright light in middle with + and x on top. Flashing lights that continued for a second after I close my eyes is all I got Flashing mainly red, deep blue, more black. Some fuzzy static. Almost like the flashes were “waves” coming from where the phone/test was outward.  It smooth transitioning “waves, but static between them. Occasionally there was green “star I” mixed with the red and deep, deep blue/black “waves” of light. flashing red and black, then moving red and black, from left to right flasing red and black, then a dark spot at the point of focus would come on and flash rapidly a couple of times then stop for a few seconds. slowly this resolved to a colour spot , mainly green and the flashing sequence would be longer, up to a few seconds. Towards the middle, I started to see a pattern, like mud flats occasionally, towards the end, as I blinked I would see a flash of a grid pattern flicker blended together.  screen appears to physical move from time to time. flickering and warping flickering red and black with superimposed black blobs, a fast spinning cross, that split into 2 then 4 crosses, lots of static-noise like images (visual snow). there was also a very quick flash of bright green that was almost imperceptible. I had no control over the images and most images seemed more like optical illusions rather than images created with my mind. Flickering rotating fuzzballs Flickering screen, basically nothing flickering which seemed to be shapeless, light specks, in formless aggregations For the first 5 or so minutes it was nothing but a quickly flashing red screen. The white noise and screen together gave me an uneasy feeling, but nothing noteworthy, just a ""If this was a horror movie this would be the part where someone dies"" feeling. Nothing serious, just subtle in the back of my mind, I was fine to continue viewing - I think it was more the white noise static than anything -.
After a while (around 5m) I realized that if I stared at a point, It would seem like everything was flickering from that point. It was around this time that the blue hues started appearing as well. They did not interfere with the red, it was more like I was seeing ""in-between"" the red flashes, just the screen would for a fraction of a second appear blue between flashes of red. 
Occasionally the focus point would have somewhat different shades of red (generally lighter, as if an outdent or maybe indented from the rest?), and this would continue slightly in short maybe inch long lines sun-raying out from the point. However these lines would pretty much disappear when I blinked. 
At one point after staring for maybe 3 minutes the pace of flickering increased and it got a  yellowish hue, flashing red to yellow to grey-blue, but this effect did not last for more than 2 or 3 seconds before it went back to just red and grey/blue. I was unable to repeat the effect. However, whenever I looked at a point for long enough, it did feel like the rate of flickering increased.

I never had anything other than a red flicker on a Thinkpad in a dark bedroom with scary static though. Frequency of flicker seemed to have a varying harmonic between 1 and 3 seconds
No real patterns as such, only slightly brighter and slightly dimmer areas Fuzzy ball of varying shape. Kind of like a video of the suns surface (changing burning plasma). Besides that I felt really sleepy - dazed of a couple of times, eyes closed. Fuzzy ball with spiderwebs fuzzy blurs of red/black/white Gray and white starburts, floating black semicircle and arcs, static gray fuzz, the screen looked like it went white several times green balls of light within the  flickering red and black background. green flashes between red flashes Green flashes rather like a very diffuse fog or trees breathing in pollen season like the Smokies. Green on the borders, lines, balls Greenish grid overlaying flicker when I blinked grid of dots and the suggestion of something faint moving fluidly around the screen H halka halka yıldız figürleri gördüm ağaç figürü ekranın her tarafı kapladığını ekranın kenarlarında yarım daireler gördüm tek bir ekranın bir anda iki tane olduğunu gördüm hearts, crap, patterns, spiderwebs, grids High resolution morphing black and red squares and rectangles.  An occasional red circle that was blurry. Circle was first thing I noticed. A black rectangle in the middle was the image that showed most often with red rectangles on each side, 3 stripes. Honestly, I watched it two times. The first time was with my eyes open. Then I get to see like an unclear black X in the middle of the screen. If I try to focus on it I can't really focus on it. The second time I had my eyes closed while watching at the screen. I saw sort of greenish dots moving on a red background. Then after a short while I experienced light coming in from the above that got brighter and brighter. It was not actual light, but more of a brightiss white, but not clear white. Then I got other colors that I can't really remember at this point and then I stopped after maybe 3 minutes. When I opened my eyes after that the screen was more of orange color and seemed more solid than red/black flicker. I could not see anything but could still tell what was supposed to be there. It was from the view point of the edge of a pond, there was a clear sky with stars, a few clouds, and waning crescent moon. On the far edge and wrapping around the shore was a treeline that consisted of birch like trees (tall and thinner wih plenty of canopy, but were not birches) and some juniper trees, it was accompanied with average pond foliage like cattails and reeds and such. There were dragonflys, frogs, flies, birds, and fish, oh and a turtle that had climbd outta the moss and onto a dead tree that was partially submerged. Its almost like i could touch it before I'd be able to see it.  i didn’t really see shapes or balls of light or anything… it’s hard to describe, but I wouldn’t say I “saw” shapes… I saw flickering red/dark with maybe some shapes within the flicker for example it was just solid red/solid dark but more like dark in the middle with a circular fade to red like a vignette and then dark around the edges again, perhaps with some patterning in the dark around the edge, this was pretty much constant for the full 10 mins … perhaps as i moved my eyes around and refocused I saw slightly different patterns/rotations but i wouldn’t label it as “geometric” shapes with any kind of defined boundaries etc I don’t know if I actually saw the visions as much as I felt they were there. I got the impression of a forest off in the distance, then an ocean the a crowd of people as if on a busy street  I found that I could control the ""waves"" of flicker as they rolled over the screen. If I wanted to see faces, I could but I tried not to. I saw geometric shapes as well as tendril shapes resembling flowers and something one would see under a microscope. I have no mind's eye so it's hard to describe without visual, it kept changing really fast like glitched video I honestly thought that I saw nothing until I looked at these survey questions. Then, I realized that there was a very faint sort of glow in the center of the screen. It seemed to be that it was kind of an oval shape far away. It made me think of a person at the end of a tunnel. If I closed my eyes, even just to blink, I could see some greenish webbing, but when I opened my eyes, I couldn't really see that on the screen. The experience was very unpleasant for me, so I found it hard to process what I was seeing. Mostly it just seemed like flashing red, with perhaps the edges seeming a bit darker (like a sort of rectangle around the image) at times. I may have seen very small simple spirals -but I wanted to see something - but I really couldn't I might have seen some faint patterns, kind of like ladybugs. They looked a little like protein floaters in my eye, except the were stuck to the screen, not my visual field.  I mostly saw a kaleidoscope effect that would spin either clockwise or counter-clockwise for a few seconds before changing shape or spinning the opposite way in a different pattern.  Occasionally I could see a shape briefly form at the center of the screen that would slowly rotate before disolving into a kaleidoscopic effect. I mostly saw geometric shapes.  A small amount of 3d effect.  I could largely guide the perception, like identifying shapes in cloud.  The only image that was slightly out of the ordinary (considering I was watching a flashing screen) was when a bright streak bounced around the screen, which I quickly figured out I could control.  Most imagery that wasn't a simple geometric pattern started from the edge of the screen. I observed occasional drifting of red and black lines (reminiscent of blank film reel) I only experienced a pulsating blue colour. No images or sounds. i only saw a rectangular pattern. Almost like a rectangular spiderweb.  I only saw black lines narrow in on the screen as my eyes adjusted. I could control them by adjusting my focus. I only saw flickers of blue-green, the complement of the warm red on the screen. I saw 99.9% black and red flashing. lines, triangles, fractals. for a brief moment the outline of cartoon 'yogi bear', but pretty weak and unclear. I saw a cracked texture, like the bottom of dried lake, then it changed to be more like a moonscape topography. The colour became more like navy and red. The texture was faint and flashing and made up of the colours that were flashing. I saw a giant X in the middle and it kept expanding taller and wider. A circle would appear then it turned into a long tunnel. I saw a rectangle on either side of the screen, both with a lot of static. I saw a grid and a heart shape I saw a red cats eye in the center of the screen after 5-7 minutes of watching.  Before that I was seeing small attached bubble like objects in blue and green I saw a screen flashing.  That's pretty much it.  There were times when I noticed how the screen was filling in... like diagonally from the top left down to the lower right.  I may have seen areas in the red that were brighter than others. I saw a triangle a couple times. I saw angular zig-zagged lines, usually 1 at a time. Reminded me of looking at a bright light with my eyes closed. I saw cells like a honeycomb, rather squares. I solve one sudoku every day, usually with a high degree of complexity, I made an association with sudoku and the images of the squares stopped. I could just see the flickering black-and-red light. It was not unpleasant, but I got tired, I got bored after 3-4 minutes. I saw circles and lines, I tried to shape them but was unable to alter my perception of them. I would see the red transition into black from certain sides, like a screen refreshing. I saw dark blueish (probably because of black flicker) grid/geometric shapes on red background but not in detail and it wasn't sustainable. It changed quickly. I was trying to maintain a shape of number 8 but couldn't do it for more than few seconds. I saw dark green flickering  blobs - smaller nearer the centre of the screen. The screen appeared to move up and down with low amplitude and a frequency of about 100 Hz I saw diamonds of black and red that occasionally shifted to angled bars slowly sweeping across the image. I saw different red and black patterns, such as a ball of black pulsing out or inwards, bouncing and swirling shapes / patterns. After several minutes I saw a left eye, sketch-like, which rotated and disappeared then reappeared several times. I saw only that one image. I saw lines, borders, shapes  I saw lines, colours move in circles and I started to get dizzy, I thought I saw jockeys on race horses and I saw beautiful colours, orange, green, yellow i saw lots of blue. the image seemed to move constantly from side to side. the image seemed to get wider and narrower. there were orange narrow bars on the left and right margins. only twice did i see anything different: a very quick image of clouds and a diamond pattern that covered the screen. the latter was simultaneous with a myoclonic seizure. I saw mainly hexagonal shapes next to each other as if you placed them together edge to edge. They usually made up a larger hexagonal shape that was about 20% of the field and around it were other hexagonal shapes like edge to edge with it. Almost like when you're looking at those zoom in fractals and it's just a repeating video as it zooms in, if that makes sense. It actually very much reminded me of what things look like when I'm on acid. I see similar hexagonal shapes etched into whatever I'm looking at. At one point I saw what almost looked like a geometric flower too. And I could see a very light green sometimes but only in the middle of the image. Almost like that thing where you stare at a red for a while and then look at the wall, that kind of green. I saw quickly shifting ripples, fireworks, fractals, and other complex geometric designs, which were black on a red backdrop.  I began to also see streaks of white.  After a while, I began to see what looked like red fog or dust around the edges of the monitor.  At least twice, the perception of the entire screen changed into red and white noise (like static) which was extremely disturbing and seemed totally real.   I saw several loose geometric patterns emerge from the center of my vision, and they were mostly fuzzy kaleidoscopic triangles, squares, and squiggles that shifted, morphed, spiraled, swirled and changed rotation. Occasionally the shapes would form a fuzzy but slightly more complex checkerboard, honeycomb, or fractal pattern, but there were no shifts in color or any more complicated visuals for me.  I saw shapes of fruit, like eggplant, apples, bananas. I saw the color blue a lot and almost like an outline of a person's silhouette  I saw sine lines overlapping in a 360 degree around my focal point I saw single letters at a time, each morphed into the next I saw some colours like yellow, green, orange. The patterns of color transitions had changed and there were circular movements in some parts of the screen. i saw some impossible colours like those stare at this for a minute thingys and your eyes see colours that arent there.  i frequently get images burned in my eyes like for example a black screen with white text leaves afterimage, but not during the flicker test. I saw spirals. Everything constantly spinning. I saw greens and blues but only those two colors I saw the red as a static background and the black  seemed to move across the screen. Mostly right to left, sometimes top to bottom. I saw transparent hexagon-like pixels rotating in a fractal like pattern.  The red remained constant, but the black became a dark green, and then alternated to different color harmonies (primary, secondary, tertiary, etc.) in each frame. The top corners of each of these colored frames were darker, and the bottom corners lighter. The hexagon pixels became more of lines moving up and down, then side to side.  The left and right edges of the frame then became a pulsating light yellow.  I saw what looked like a chess board shape, then a grid of black lines (similar to the optical illusion where you look at a grid with thick black lines and see circles appear at where the lines intersect), then concentric circles that started from a black spot in the center, then spiderwebs. While I experienced those visuals in that order initially, they did appear in random order afterwards. After about 5 minutes, most all visuals relatively disappeared and I was unable to see anything except the screen changing colors (with small hints of the chess board shape). The shapes all appeared black visually. I saw yellow balls and orange instead of red occasionally, probably my red cones getting weary or something. I started seeing a lot of blue, like a blue sky with some light cloud cover I think it looked like words to start and then went into kinda warping black blobs I thought I might have seen a wheel. i thought i saw green flash at some points i had some geometric shapes rotating around a center point and the center point moved around a bit as well I usually see these things naturally, the images this program seeks, but after using it it gave a nice total blackness which I have never experienced before, I usually see swilling shapes turn geometrical and can sometimes force myself to crest images with the plumes of colors naturally but this took it away for a few seconds it was nice but I also feared it was gone forever until I strained my face and eyes and it all came back  I viewed the Ganzflicker for around 7ish minutes, I saw grid-like patterns and simple geometric shapes (triangles, squares, etc.) I was sensing a bit of rotation in the images from time to time, which made me a bit dizzy, and the light seemed to move a bit (this happened about 3 times in 10 minutes). But nothing much -- I wouldn't even call it seeing something. i was surprised to learn the flicker went from red to black.  I saw more of a blue color than red that it would flash to, and as some rivers would form in the center of the screen they would have orange and yellow.  then the river would move diagonally and then disappear.  I would occasionally see small boxes, ~15, flash and go away, and the sides of my computer screen would have vertical black columns.  I felt a little strange while doing this, and was actually slightly uncomfortable, telling myself i have never had a seizure, this is okay.  I did stop it earl and then go back and redo it before writing this after learning that there weer just 2 colors, red and black flashing.  The second time the patter was more like a river or a thick rainbow of lightning, but the first time it was more of an oval shape, with fractal edges that I tried to go through but would disappear when i would try.  It would then come back.  It seemed to happen in a pattern, where i could almost expect the image to form after the speed of the flicker would change, like filming a spinning wheel. I was waiting for something to happen, sometimes there were swirls. Sometimes it seemed like there was something angry trying to get out, but there weren't really any visuals. If I focused heavily on the centered red laser pointer like light, it would spin rapidly at an angle from opposite corners (top right to bottom left) like Saturn's rings. Sometimes and edge of the screen (bottom edge or the right edge) would appear lighter or darker periodically throughout which gave the experience depth & dimension. Lines and grids appeared on the periphery and ran from top to bottom of the screen (not right to left). Lines and grids were most vivid around the edges. Some lines were dotted or dashed or only partially formed.  If I shut my eyes I saw a faint check pattern If I stared a little harder into it it looked like the speed of the flicker increased and would become almost a steady red, becoming a bit brighter until I would blink. And the black would occasionally look more blue. And the screen would appear to come closer. if I'm generous, maybe the sense that the pulsing was moving around, maybe there was a ball shape images that were on the screen could have been manifestations of anything  In order of typical experience after imagery was 'reset' by a blink:

Colors other than red/black (green, blue, yellow). These would go away and there would be a general feeling of motion, as if the screen itself were drifting but not actually seeing motion. Apparent motion was generally in a diagonal direction. 3-4 lines would form (spaced respectively ~120 or 90 degrees apart) radiating out from where I was looking, which would rotate around clockwise or counterclockwise (sometimes switching direction). Alternating dark/light bands moving in from the edges or out from the center. The lines collapsed into a point or small circle which would drift around the screen, and the dark/light bands would flow from that point giving a sensation like going through a tunnel (very similar to stereotypical ""traveling through a wormhole"" imagery in any number of popular sci-fi TV shows or movies). After a few seconds of this I usually would have to blink and the images would be gone."

As the experiment continued, I saw large Vs which were colored like a rainbow floating down from the top of the screen to the bottom continuously. Indistinct patterns of lighter red that moved in a circular fashion, or away or from me. If I looked only with one eye the patterns/motion were different for the right and left eyes. It almost immediately turned into a flicker of many times the speed as the original rate. Then brighter and darker spots began to take form, and move in spiral patterns. There was a hint of deeper patterns, but it also had the TV static feel. After some time, I started to perceive blues, and the pattern rotation went away. A couple times, I saw shapes that seemed distinct and real, such as a dark forest. The other times were vague and felt impossible to describe. I looked away a couple times, which seemed to trigger a reset on the sensation, but it was always very fast to immerse again. Also, the patterns seemed to match up with the audio in a way that was hard to describe... like there was a baseline that matched up with certain expansions of the light portions of the flickering. It felt like I was going down a square tunnel in space It felt like nothing at the time, but after reading the answer options I realized the blue shapes and patterns I was seeing did count. There were a few moments here and there where I thought I saw a pendulum swinging or what looked like a lunar eclipse for a brief moment, but I had to keep refocusing my eyes because without anything to focus on, they kept drifting and I was worried that would affect it. Without detailed instructins (how far away to sit, where to look/focus, if our eyes naturally crossed was that okay? etc) I found myself preoccupied with the how and not able to really focus on what, if anything, I was seeing. It felt very confusing like i was straining to make sense of what I saw or if I was even seeing anything at all. It was more like simple patterns but with no actual repetition to it. It seemed like they were thick and thin sporadic lines moving in all directions, maybe a few circular shapes as well. None of the “shapes or patterns” were clear and they all were red and black. It gave me an immediate headache and was very unusual and frightening  It hurt my eyes to look at it, the red and black was flashing and i could make out some blue corners that morphed into other things that i couldn't make out very well, overall no clear images of anything apart from those blue square corners/lines. It looked like a spiral that was going clock wise then anti clock wise and then I saw it from different angels as it rotated quicker then slowed down and repeated that mostly It looked like a spiral that was going clock wise then anti clock wise and then I saw it from different angels as it rotated quicker then slowed down and repeated that mostly The patterns were generally spiralling out from the centre of the screen, focusing somewhere else on the screen seemed to make the patterns start there and work towards the centre. It reminded me of a kaleidoscope that just kept turning It seemed as if I saw green and white between the red and black flashes. I occasionally could see a black X shape across the red flash. It seemed like annoying red and black flickering, but after a while could see slightly different colours. Not much though, and did not feel at any time that I was getting into it.  It seemed like, at times, I could sense a spiral movement in the red/black strobe.  At times, the color seemed overall grey. it seemed to go from flickering red/black to flickering red/blue and then finally almost just solid red.   It started as nothing, but I was very anxious since I have what I call ""full force aphantasia"" which means I have absolutely no sense of smell, tough, taste, sight, or hearing in my head, so I was worried that I may have hallucinations or hear things that could scare me, but as time went on nothing really changed. By what felt about the 1/2 way point I began to relax, and I began to see small distortions in the screen. First it was the area around the edge of the screen turning more pale, and occasionally white, then the lights started flickering in a slower rhythm, but I refocused my eyes and it went back to normal. At what I assume was about the 7 minute point I began to see distortions that looked like horizontal diamonds, or possibly eyes, but there were many of them, in no apparent order. They were by no means vivid, but it seemed like it was parts of my eyes registering the change in colour faster than others, rather than a hallucination. After about 30 seconds my vision went back to normal. I heard no huge change in the audio, but by the 6 minute mark the audio sounded like rain, possibly in a rain forest. And once the test was finished my vision was a bit wavy around the edges, and I had tinnitus in both ears for about 7 minutes afterwards. It started off as geometric patterns and it was almost like to it was teasing me with images hidden behind those patterns that I could glimpse but not see. The edges eventually began distorting and I guess they appeared blue and green and yellow but I didn't think anything of it until now. Blobs that looked like dark ink splotches traveled across the screen undulating into other blobs, chased by spiderweb golden threads of indescript shape.  It was an enjoyable sensation, very relaxing, but despite simple geometric lines and patterns I didn't see anything. But most of the time I didn't notice the flashing, it looked like a dark orange screen. It was basically a line.  Reminded me of pictures of the backbone of the galaxy It was just a black grid on a red screen. It was like a music visualizer, but without any notable shapes. The reason I hesitate to call what I saw any shape is that it was more like what you might see if you close your eyes and press on your eye lids - there's a visual sensation but it's hard to describe. Mostly there was a feeling of motion created based on which part of the screen I was looking at. Looking at the center was like going down a tunnel, looking at any side of the screen was like spinning and having whatever you were looking at leave a strobing after-image. Like if your eyes had a really low refresh rate. it was like a tunnel it was like spirals, and after like 4 or 5 minutes I think, it had other colors in it like blue and green. It was like there was a sun orbiting around the center of the screen with a square like fractal ever expanding and spinning  it was mostly movement of the colors, like if i focused on a particular movement pattern then my screen would enlongate in a particular way and i could see other colors (mostly light blue and green) It was still red and black,but it almost looked like it was glitching. After I looked away, my vision ""swirled"" for a few seconds. It was uninteresting. It was unpleasant, just a constant going back and forth between the two colours, the black was like plaid and the middle became white-ish at points. It left me with a headache.  Just a ball of lighter red in the top left of the screen Just a bit of blue and white interspersed with the flashing red and almost black. Just a flickering red and black screen which started to get faster  Just black and red flickering, sometimes it's blurred and I saw a blueish white colour just blotches, nothing special just colors other than red and black, something similar to chromatic aberration. just different flickering / ""standing waves"" from red / black percieved at different timing across field of vision just flashing red and black, yea, I dont know how to really explain it. just looked like some round shapes and lines all over screen.  Just morphing shapes of various shades of red all over the screen just patterns, nothing that didn't seem like it was due to the monitor. Just random shapes and oscillations Just red and black light what I see  Just shapes , and lines  just some weird shape of color Just speed of flash changes to fast then to almost stand still then longer black longer red then fast slow agian  Just square shapes, and the light flashing. My eyes wanted to focus on the center of the screen. I didn't experience much more than that. just the flashes of light nothing else.  Just the flashing and a few dots. It never changed. I admit I did not watch more than a couple minutes. It made me uncomfortable. Just the symbol ""И"" Just the usual visual ""snow"" (like the ""snow"" on a non-broadcasting TV station) with flickering red and black. I did seem to see a small optical illusion where it looked like the top inch or so of the browser window was black, gradually grading into red (akin to applying a narrow black gradient on a red background). The grading was vertical, but a little lumpy horizontally (kind of like how glaze on the rim of a cup has a lumpy inconsistent edge). There were also changes in perceived depth of field; it felt less like the flat surface of a computer screen and more like it should be possible to peer into, although I didn't see any objects, just the usual ""snow."" The visual snow seemed like it occasionally had more short linear segments than is typical (rather than being  composed of simple snow ""pixels"" as is usually the case for me). However, I wouldn't know if that's what I would expect to happen, if for example, I stared at a blank wall for 10 minutes; I do have ""floaters"" in my normal vision. just turning like a corridor with red and black, sometimes more red, sometimes more black, it was like the old fashion screensavers which is like moving very fast in a color corridor. i saw it happens in blue and more rare yellow and green. i did not see any proper object sometimes again rarely spiderwebs and some kind of light games. better description for what i saw, old fashion screensavers like windows 98 :) or winamp eq. shapes. jusy weak flashes of yellow blue and green in a sort of vague network kalideoscopic shapes, still in redish hues Kind of saw some rings for a while, and then it started to turn to other random stuff. Don't recall anything more than shapes.  kinda like the patterns when you close your eyes but less light balls, grooves Like a honeycomb like a paht on my way but i cant see just feeling like peacefull area  like a sine/cosine wave oscillating about 3 times in a second like fast flashes in screen thant change between red, black and a little yellow (not sure at 100%) like if you scribbled a circle with a blue pen and it rotated  Like staring at some intense light source, overstimulating the photoreceptors in the eye that results in that greenish afterimages, shaped loke my cellphone screen. Kinda amazing, because staring at cellphone for the same period at same brightness level does not produce such afterimages. Like walking through a fpp video game. Like, passing through columns with a glow in the centre. Some flashing geometrics, faint, and moving, twisting triangles. lines and x patterns Lines like cracks in a phone at the edges of the flashing immediately disappearing; and the black started to look more like navy as time went on beginning just before the lines appeared. Saw about 4 sets of lines in the 9 minutes, beginning at about 3 mins to 6 minutes then not again. Lines of brighter/darker red parallel to sides of screen, small dots of bright blue and green, large areas of darker blue. Black  came to look dark blue.  lines of light; screen red on one side black on the other; w/o the white noise I saw a ball of light in the center of the screen w/ ray coming out around it Lines that spiraled in like box-turtle shell design - lines that jumped about.  Later saw multiple colors flashing and seemed like movement from right to left, like a train moving through a forest at night, with the flashes of lighter interspersed between darker columns.  Later almost seemed like amorphous dark shapes were moving from sides toward center, almost as if going up steps/ramp to a mid-point platform.   Little shapes, like snowflakes Looked like a flickering screen. Couldn't tell how exactly the flickering was filling the screen. Noticed that wherever my eye focused, that location on the screen seemed the origin of the flickering. looked like colors in motion looked like dots which were connected with lines  Looking up at ceiling full of lights looks like transparent things floating on the screen, very intangible, as if I'm looking at the microbes in water under a microscope (but less clear) Lots of connected circles Lots of red flashing. Did not notice the black. At some point white started to join in and it felt more like an alternation between white and red with blue sometime popping in between the two at the end of the whole experience. At the start I saw vague patterns that made me think of tree branches spread out over the screen. Later on, the screen started to zoom in as if it was getting closer to my face a few times. At some random points there would be black blobs all gathered in the center of the screen that I ignored but have to admit were there. Mainly few unstructured chaotic black dots not really a lot. Sometimes it turned to a green surface but notstable mavi rengi maybe some cubes, some corners  moon surface more black than red after a bit , green/grayish tinge at the edges of the screen
 at some points., also for around 20 seconds i maybe saw rainbow colours very slightly at the edges of some blurs on the outside of the red parts in the black. Most of the time I saw very distant small balls and lines of light that would try to connect to each other causing diamond / argyle patterns.  At moments they were just straight vertical lines glowing slightly brighter, or small flashes of balls with no lights that would then disappear.  All of these balls / lines / patterns were very distant and blurred.  It started to stain my eyes trying to maintain sight of them.   Mostly a circle moving Mostly a few dark lines, but also a few dark rectangular shapes. mostly blue flashes mixed with the red and black Mostly colors and vision would cross i saw blues,greeens,white at one pointand some purple mostly different colours / shades of colour - red, pink, green, blue, yellow. A few lines, star bursts but only in brief flashes Mostly distortions and simple shapes from middle to edges and vice versa Mostly fireworks, balls of light, grid pattern, etc.  Once I thought I saw a cobra, but that was more like trying to see things in clouds.  It was faint and quit quickly.  I really wanted to see something Mostly flashy white lines, but also various colors. Sometimes a ball of light moving along, or the lines forming a formation (similar to star formations) Mostly flickering with some lines and geometries Mostly geometric shapes, with 'waves' of that shape reminiscent of a moiré, emanating to fill field of vision occupied by Ganzflicker. . For example a full-screen plus, that would switch colors with each flash, and each time it switched colors the old color would get displaced in every direction (so you'd be left with right-angle color bands moving towards each corner). The same thing, but with a diagonal cross on the screen. Radial lines from the center, rotating clocking or counterclockwise. An alternating checkerboard. With more time between blinks: weirder, less regular patterns, with a different color each 'frame'. Occasionally the sense of a 3D object, but not clear imagery of it - like tracking a plane flying by, ""turning"" towards it flying away.

I also tried watching it in a VR headset with it filling my entire field of view. There were still patterns, but they were much less clear - more like full color changes of all or nearly all of my entire field of view rather than detailed patterns. In VR it was super easy to also see patterns with eyes closed, as it lit up the eyelids better. mostly it was just a difficult to discern pattern of red and black but occasionally the red would partially coalesce into orbs and form a tunnel or grid Mostly just saw a bunch of lines, some curved lines, and a few circles. The most intense thing I saw was instead of red/black flashes, it became static red/black squares. Their appearance reminded me of the old tv static, especially with the white noise playing. The squares in the top left became smaller and the squares everywhere else became bigger, eventually shifting to the sides of the screen and morphed into flashing spikes. The spikes were 'attached' to the edge of the screen pointing in. More spikes appeared in a radial pattern in the center. After that, everything started rotating and stretching as if going down a spiral. After a few seconds, everything became so stretched and distorted that the spikes just merged back into the red/black flashing. This happened around 3/4 minutes in, and nothing else like it happened. Mostly random red/black MOVING patterns of light with varying intensity. Mostly repeating shapes and fractal-ish nonsense Mostly shapes like concentric triangles or circles, animated spirals also happened alot.Near the end it almost seemed to be scrolling along like a camera panning. The patterns were faint, and had washed out shades of colors like blue, purple, and orange in addition to black and red. mostly spirals and black hole type things but rarely a pattern of shapes Mostly vague, alternating distortions of screen warping and rapidly ""racing by"" horizontally, but toward the end of the 10 minutes I did see a rotational distortion 2 or 3 times.  It felt as though this happened when my eyes were more relaxed, but I could not recreate that distortion intentionally. moving square"

There appeared to be a touch of green color mixed in with the red and black, but no specific shapes from that. I did imagine a ball of light flashing in the center, but it wasn't constant. I also saw brief flashes of small squares in the two upper corners of my screen, but it may have been related to square images that are there anyway. But I saw nothing particularly vivid. clear, or enduring. My eyes kept creating a photo negative of the red which showed up as blue. Sometimes it would look like a water ripple. Then towards the end there was a white line in my left periphery My eyes started watering almost immediately. After around 10 seconds, I saw flickering black and red checkered squares in the form of a X with a vertical line, moving into the screen. If I slightly unfocused my eyes then I would see the black and red checkered squares rotating in concentric circles. It started out clockwise but could change directions. My primary perception was of rotating vortices, comprised of reds, tints of red and hints of yellow. Sometimes central on the screen, sometimes moving across it. Often I saw multiple vortices, sometimes superimposed upon each other, sometimes occupying separate spaces on the screen. When I was seeing multiple vortices, sometimes they would counter-rotate, sometimes they rotated in the same direction. Also direction rotation would vary, in some cases rotation would stop and then reverse direction. No images only patterns of colors flashing. The origin of the patterns moved about the screen nonsense. hardly images. moving into and out of a chessboard like pattern, sometimes more globe like not much honestly, occasionally a circle would appear in the center with squiggly lines emanating from it which reached to end of screen.  if i looked directly at corner or edge of screen it would appear jagged.  as if someone cut long thin notches along the sides, consecutive in size.  not much.  maybe some bluish patches Not much. Just a few squares or lines  Occasional impression of a square oriented like a diamond on a playing card. Occasionally if I didn't blink for awhile it would start looking abit like a kaleidoscope In the flashing. However, to be clear what I'm seeing I am seeing on the tv screen itself, nothing in my minds eye.  Of course, lots of flickering.  Some faint gray lines that reminded me of what I sometimes see when I have my eyes closed but there is strong light source.  They sort of randomly cross over each other and collectively formed two circles.  One on the left side of the screen and one on the right.  Red and black, but the flickering caused some grays.  movement with the flickering and at one time it was moving back and forth from side to side and then sort or rotating almost like spinning illusions. I almost stopped then, but it went back to similar flickering as at the beginning. On phone: vein-like dark lines on periphery of my view. On TV: very light (almost yellow) color on left and right edges, two vertical  and three horizontal black lines Only black, red screen and sometimes green coloured small shapes at the corners of the screen  Only flashes of red, yellow and black light. Only occasional colour changes from red to pink to blue. only slight visual ""dust"" around the edges of the monitor, kinda like glowing sand
sometimes the flickering took shapes like a circle going around, but this disappeared when i refocused my eyes / blinked Only thing ifound was how fast the 10 minutes went. Felt like only a few minutes Orange yellow purple green and something that looked like a spider web or perhaps the shape of where lightening had struck or tree roots. Over a black/white background, the red appeared to start as a ring and expand. There was a random selection of strait lines in the background patterns, kind of like a gird texture that moved from the center to the outer edges of the screen. sometimes triangular, or square.  patterns, often in the form of spider webs perceived patterns in the flashing.  Had the impression of passing quickly through a tunnel that would bend in the direction I focused my eyes.  Similar to driving a lighted highway at night while passing streetlights. pink little balls pinpoint small dots of light in the center, strips of light on the sides, a halo of pin point lights all around the computer periphery, black shapes with right angles. Pretty much nothing other than blobs of light. I did see some colors but I suppose my eyes were tired of just seeing red and black. I saw plenty of white and green and yellow. Primarily white lines, occasionally grids. Background of room (beyond my monitor) at one point did seem to fill with a rotating mist of some sort, but I assumed this was a consequence of looking away from the screen. Pulsating red and black that synchronized with my breathing  Purple sun like object moving in circles in the middle of the screen at brief seconds a dark bar that ran through the middle of the purple ball (sun like) object Q1 Rainbows (seemed to have all the colors of a rainbow) appearing from all directions like lightning bolts Random darkness in random positions repeating, sometimes they would look like or form shapes, generally just looked like nothing random lines, and some vague patterns of blobs almost like at interference pattern or ripples in a pond starting at the center of the screen Random patterns and mixing white light with red and black Random scratches, Lissajous patterns, triangles with balls at vertices. Rapid changing of random shapes like circles and squares or circles and patterns rotating razor blades, toothed saw, circle with explosions, faces, a mercury thermometer that seemed to be exploding up (reminded of the recent Seattle heat wave I just suffered through), tunnel, cannons set back to back, many more things than I can recall. Really indistinguishable. Like those caliedascopic telescope toys given to us as kids but as if you were watching with poor eyesight and no glasses. red  with black/grey smoke almost passing through red and black - maybe a fuzzy yellowish circle  Red and black annoying flashing that included grids, checker pattern, vertical and horizontal lines alternating. Constant linear lines in either direction or both/multiple. Irritating. Red and black checker board Red and black flashing at the same time as if the screen was spotted in red and black and the spots were moving Red and Black, at first alternating, then the two colours at the same time in splotches moving about, it moves more as I move my eyes over the screen. Feels like a result of my eyes getting tiered.   Red and blue colours. Round shapes in an X form; or round shapes in a O form Red and blue flickering light the whole time. Nothing more. red black and yellow flashing Red changes to white. Fain stripes here and there. Sometimes different flashing patterns on different corners  red flickering diamond shapes, blue background, fan/train motion Red, Black and Blue Flicker a sense of rotation both clockwise and counter clockwise alternating, at the end a period of barring moving left to right Red, black and blue light flickering and in between about to Times a snowflake Like pattern persisting for some Seconds. regularly repeated patterns reminded me of the alex grey art, OVERSOUL, with the patchwork of black and red radiating outword. At times it morphed into a rectangular shaping that was rotating on its horizontal axis with the screen having a shrinking effect, and 3 dimensional depth feelings emerging. repeating moving patterns in changing color(it shift gradually between mostly red and blue) Roads  Rotating distorted grids, red black green and white, a point of light that would move rapidly across the screen in a path that was rotating like along tangents. Further along, I began to se crystalline geometric patterns that would rotate come and go. rotating lines and patterns Rotating screen, either direction, varyring spiderweb sizes of mesh, not regular like a real web, web black, some areas of dark green/blue. saw a swirl in the middle, arrows pulsing, flashes of black streaks across a white backround, towards the end stick figure legs that moved like they were skiing Saw crosshairs and faded circle around (behind?) the crosshairs. Was morphing in shape and shade to shades or red to white to black. Center and edges of the screen faded to darker or lighter at times like an after image in an optical illusion. Saw latice pattern the most vivd, other than that, lots of fuzzy abstract shapes. Saw out of focus letters and words that swirled clockwise around the screen. Shapes and lines appeared on the periphery and also appeared to be moving in a circle.  scratches or dust like seen in an old film screen appeared to be flickering, balls and lines of light, orange, blue, green screen comes closer. i also got some thing like macropsia after that Screen would sometimes bounce around, get smaller and larger, diamond shapes, angles seemed like I may have seen some lines and geometric shapes. Seemed like the red/blue flicker started to speed up. Then I started to see white spider webbed lines. Those went away and I went back to just seeing the flicker. Then about a min later I saw yellow spider webbed lines and some yellow/orange bursts of light. It felt like the computer screen was almost transparent.  seemed like the silhouette of a city skyline at bottom of field Shadows Shape shifting like a kaleidoscope of colors and lines Shapes that exploded into new shapes, constantly morphing, I saw the color blue. Shifting intervals of red and black. Sometimes the screen appeared black with only brief flashes of red, and sometimes it appeared red with only brief flashes of black. These fluctuations lasted for perhaps 4-5 seconds before returning to the regular pattern of flashing. simple four and five pointed stars Slowly mutating blue mesh in the periphery, concentric rapidly zooming red circles at visual focus. Multicoloured mottling of the surrounding display frame. small circle , x shape , but can't make up square shape for some reason , can see triangle easily some bright steal blue noise some greenish colours here and there white disortions, and a diagonal grid  some lines, mooving to the side  some squiggly lines Some yellow, blue, and orange and then later briefly a black rectangle in the center Sometimes a series of circles travelling towards me - like a spaceship traveling through a wormhole - very vague and unclear. Later I saw lines criss-crossing the screen like veins sometimes circles were a worm. sometimes everywhere I looked there were crosshairs similar to fps games. sometimes it was a propeller Sometimes it seemed as if the red or black screens switched their times and alternated their flickerings Sometimes it seemed as if there was a swaying motion of the whole visual field, back and forth, from left to right. Other times lines of color would emanate from a ball of light. The ball of light was generally located towards the upper right of the screen, but sometimes it would move across the top of the screen, both from right to left and left to right. At one point there was the sensation of the lights rotating and also moving across the screen as they rotated. Towards the end of the ten minutes I saw something that looked like a grid or spiderweb of black lines in the center of the screen. Sometimes the red and black quickly made patterns like stripes, but only on small areas on the screen at a time, not the whole screen and only in very short glimpses. Some of the time I saw a bit of white color, a bit like lightning, but not very clearly. sone weird rainbow kind of lights or things like horizontal or stripes but nothing else Spider webs, swirling vortexes, zig zags like dragging paint from one color to another and back. Mostly pattern-style things. spiders Spinning geometric shapes after a few minutes. They would get faster and more complex until I blinked, and then it would be just flashing red and black again for a few seconds, and then it would start in on the shapes again. Spirals were the common theme, whether they were focused around the center or around the edges, there was also a tunnel that sometimes appeared that it looked like I was zooming through it Square grids, rotating lines Squiggly lines Started out with just the flicker, then a color change (some white, some green), some shapes in the flicker (circles mostly, morphing in and out) and at some points it seemed  expand beyond the monitor.  Started to see soft striping instead of solid fairly soon; sometimes the strips shifted a bit.  Next I started seeing small starbursts of lines that were brighter red than the rest of the image.  Eventually started seeing a lot of this black lines and increased into looking like heavy static, like on a REALLY old movie real.  Nothing I would call a ""shape"", just some cool line effects. Swirling white lights, mushrooms, white lines teeth and fangs The black changed to blue  The color seemed to turn brown and yellow. There was some pattern which reminded me of Moiree the colors changed and i thought i saw flashes of geometric shapes"

The experience made me nauseated. I feel like I was seeing the vasculature of my inner eye. I could see the veins in black as almost weblike in two circular patterns that appears to be each of my eyes. There was an empty space in the middle of each circle on the left and right with the black branches surrounding the empty space. The flickering in the center appeared to not be in sync with the rest of the flicker. I saw flickering grids, concentric circles, and lines radiating from the center. the illusion of objects/shapes moving at speed.  Sharp lines in the images, changing rapidly The light turned orange and yellow mostly but also a little green at the 5min mark but not for long. Saw a black circle too. The light looked like it was filling the whole screen and spilling out of the phone a little but that may have just been the way the light was reflecting or somthing The only thing I saw was a faint cross-like shape after staring directly in the center for a long time, with the vertical and horizontal line intersecting there in the middle. I saw no other images besides that. The red seemed to turn slightly orange by the end of 10 minutes, and if I glanced at the corner of the screen I saw a little bit of yellow in the corners. No other colors. The patterns I saw were like they were impressions on a fabric, made of creases maybe. Very vague. I saw flashes of blue and yellow sometimes. I felt like the edges of my monitor were undulating, and like I could see the refresh cycle of my monitor (red moving vertically down rather than flashing the whole screen at once). The red started looking more like white and seemed to stay longer than the black periods. Flicker would increase if I breathed or blinked. Started to see almost blue or green in the black periods. Almost saw what might have been a star shape but colored in a way reminiscent of what happens if you stare at a single spot for a long time (shifting colors). The screen appeared to start flowing left, then flowing right, and finally emanated from the right corner of the screen. I forced my eyes straight (3d vision, like for a magic eye book) and saw static/water particles floating toward me, as if I were swimming against a river's stream. Finally, everything I blinked, I saw a circle pattern (like on a roulette table) that alternated colors between green and a black (possible dark green) The screen eventually seemed more red than black, was easier to look at and reminded me of being in the middle of an erupting volcano. I saw a few spindly lines like fine lightning bolts, but they were faint and not large. The screen filled with diamond shapes.  They seemed to get smaller over time (more diamonds filled the screen), and then I got tired of watching after 3-4 minutes. The screen shook a bit, not quite a spiral but could say warping for a minute or so.  The screen was jumping to every other corner The very edges of the red changed shapes slightly over time, but not into anything definite, or maybe it was more that the red got a bit more/less intense over time - not sure.. the changes were subtle.  I also saw green as I blinked my eyes but don't think that was to do with the flicker - just what happens when I stare at red for a long time! The whole screen just got bigger, the black color got more dominant: like a background There was a brief moment where it seemed only slightly that there were colors other than red and black There was a random non static flickering pattern, similar to coarse Perlin noise, with a darker shade of red color. Then in the middle of my eye focus point I could see a cross spanning roughly for half of the screen, flickering too, but mainly bright red. The cross was sometimes rotating, and sometimes there was a second cross superimposed at 45 degree. The cross at times was just a line with the other branches very dimm. The cross appeared almost at the beginning of the section. Towards the end of the session I think I saw a spiral shape. Overall this imagery was very mild and barely discernable from the red background. There was just the dominating red light. a very rarely seen shapes of rings and spheres There would be geometric patterns that would rotate in three dimensions. Orange flickering background and a sort of dark blue very fuzzy rising balls, and i fell asleep almost 5 times Unusual shapes like lines, circles, etc. vague lines. Vague square in centre with squares expanding out to fill rest of screen vague suggestions of patterns. Maybe similar to national flags. various dark parts moving quickly between the screen randomly, and the sides of the screen more blurred Various geometric and organic shapes, usually with rotational symmetry. The center of the symmetry was wherever my eyes were focused. Most commonly this was like a crosshair an inch or two thick across the entire screen. It was like two lines of rectangles, vertical and horizontal, and the rectangles were defined by thin dark not-quite-black (maybe dark green) lines. When I put on the shepard tone, almost immediately what I saw changed so there were no more shapes but it seemed like the color change was a right-to-left wipe instead of an instant transition. Eventually the ""crosshair"" returned, and from that point on it was mostly just the crosshair and occasionally seeing the ""real"" flashing red and black.

Also, I never actually saw a true black. I'm not sure what color I saw, best I can describe is a very dark green. very blurred snowflake Very quick red & black flickering, some geometric repetitive shapes (like a honeycomb, for example, eternally connected) filling the entirety of the screen wherever I looked for a intantaneous flash, then just gone and lines like a scrambled tv signal from the 80's with very light snow effect right after that, all lasting just a second (if that). Recurred constantly throughout the entire experience, felt nothing at all the entire time. Very short, thin green lines. All the same length but at different angles. They were distributed evenly around the screen, not touching or in clumps. Very slight distortions around the edge. More like eyes having difficulty adjusting to the bright/dark contrast pattern with the darkness around it. Very slight grid-like patterns, sort of greenish with stars at the meeting points of the grid. Came and went.  Water or smoke Waves crossing the screen. Sometimes the source of them seemed to be in the screen upper left angle. The screen seemed being expanding at some moments. I saw a few stairs of a building, but faintly as through a mist. Waves, grids, and lines with blue green colors wavy ovals or wavy rectangles Weird distorted faces  weird green dot. can't tell if its reflection or what white blurs and random yellow lines around the screen  Yellow Yellow and white lines and balls, circles squares and lines yellow color came in with red and black other flashes of another color not sure. then just stripes and everynow and then a bunch of spheres in a grid pattern would pop in and out"

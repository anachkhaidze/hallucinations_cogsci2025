I saw the rain poured in the marble brick that outside the house. I was in the house when the rain happened. The rain was heavy. And the house that I live had old, and traditional   images appear on the screen  Move up and to right, also would look green  pusating light began red and black, morphed into red and green; later, red color dominiated and changed shade from orangy to deeper red; some glittery gold spots. Images: a city skyline, gold cubes, gold dots 
Dark gray Hexagonal lattice appeared on screen occasionally.  Flashing Red, Pink, Black background with white sometimes in center. 
Flashing colors (red>black/gray>blue>green) and amorphous shapes (cloud-like).  Sense of moving very fast through colored clouds or nebulae.   ""stars"" that got relatively bright, a cityscape outline, some random shapes, the alien figure... everything I saw was in some sort of motion (Note: I interpreted ""images"" to include ""simple shapes or patterns"" and ""colors other than red and black"". If ""images"" only refers to figurative images, please disregard my answers to those questions.)

The screen soon seemed to be divided into square tiles, usually with an orange and blue checkered pattern, although sometimes it was more complex with dark green tiles of a different shape at the corners of the other tiles. The dark green tiles were covered in a pattern of irregular, little, curly scratches. The flickers came to more or less fill my visual field. Sometimes, I'd start to see little spinning wheels around the periphery, showing through the checkered pattern, also decorated with these irregular, little, curly scratches.

Bright orange and dark blue/purple predominated. An especially bright orange/yellow glow appeared in the center of the screen. It sometimes became the center of an asterisk, with bright lines extending to the edges of my visual field. The bright lines consisted of parallel stripes of different colors, like rainbows. At one point, I saw a collection of such rainbow lines extending across my visual field from a point low down and central. Sometimes thick, bright lines would appear at various angles and offsets from the center. These lines had bright and dark bands alternating along their length. Sometimes the bright and dark bands would seem to be moving along the lines. If I concentrated, I could change the direction of movement.

When I closed my eyes, the background became paler and I'd see a network like a cobweb (centered on the middle of my visual field) of pastel green threads with pastel blue jewels at the nodes where threads met. * A grid of boxes
* Bits of blue static
* A circular vortex in the middle whenever I refocused
* Long straight lines, like an embossing, that grew and divided and moved ,,,first, thin slitted nose belonging to nonthreatentity , music drops bursting happily increasing till Wednesday said stun, stun, sun, sun , yellow filled my tastebuds reminding myself of dandelions 1 min or so in, I'm seeing the changing black and red frames neither slowing or increasing at that point. but then the image took the form of a solid golden tablet like shape, and words started flying across it with a scenery in the background that resembled a beach. that was through my eyes what I was seeing off of the screen, but I was thinking of mental images of what it would look like if I met the people who made this experiment. i saw my self shaking my hands with him or her then my attention went back to the screen and the image disappeared and it went back to flashing again.  i then proceeded to exit the window while hearing small giggling noises in my room. I'm pretty sure those were mental audio clips stored in my head since it is 11 pm and everyone is downstairs sleeping. 1) Started off as changing from red/black to going red/blue 2) 1-2 mins Then looked like water ripples in bottom left moving to top right and random turbulent water swirls. 3) 2-3 mins a clockwise spinning saw blade at the top of the screen 4) 3-5 mins.  The belly, front shoulder, legs, and feet of a running horse.  It looked like it was running so fast it had flames coming off it's hooves. 5) 5-7mins.  I blinked rapidly a bunch of times like trying to make a movie scene, but it ended up creating fat pixels on the screen and they stayed static for a couple mins. 6) 7-10 random swirls and brief flashes of the former images. (Times are approx) 1.X or I shaped yellow laser lights, just like those in windows media player, with blue or purple shade 2.round or square pattern all over the screen 3.fake chinese or japanese characters (i know these languages so i can tell that they are imaginary) 4.scenery running backward as what we see when driving 1/ Clusters of circles (about 100) growing in size over the span of 10 minutes. They appeared right at the beginning. At the beginning, blinking seemed to reduce their size, but they gradually grew larger until I could only see 3-4 on the screen. They were centered. As they grew bigger, they were starting to look like ripples or concentric circles.
2/ A cityscape. It appeared once, around 2-3 minutes in and lasted for 10-15 seconds. It may have lasted longer, but at this point the circles took my attention. It was brighter, yellow and was on the right side of the screen, vertically toward the center. It was not very detailed.
3/The flickering sometimes seemed to slow down and speed up and although at the beginning it was clearly flickering between black and red, the black ended up looking like desaturated and dark green.
4/ On my peripheral vision, outside the screen, some noise was present the whole time and on the borders of the screen but inside it, their were radial lines (only appearing on the borders) with color distorsion (red/blue/yellow). I started seeing green and blue, then beige/tan colors about 3-4 minutes in. Spiderweb-type designs, mandala/kaleidoscope designs all over the screen. A lot of focus on the center, looked like an iris of an eye, small white sphere in the center and webs coming off in every direction the edges of the screen slowly felt like they were becoming darker with more black as time went on and i startedseeing hues of orange where the black hit the rid during the flicker I first saw the rectangle of the screen expanding and contracting, then a yellow-orange ""X"" formed by connecting the corners. Little swirls of lines began to form that jumped along the ""X"" that I turned into stick figure people in my mind's eye. Once I had that thought, the X turned into a dragon that seemed to be writhing with anger as he lunged at the stick figures that had begun to throw spears at the dragon. The dragon ate some of them and scorched the rest so that I noticed the black flashes mostly at the bottom of my screen while the dragon remained orange outlined with yellow mostly toward the top of the screen. His wings unfolded to stretch and frame the top of the screen and he began bursting with flashes of light as though he had leveled up his fire breathing abilities to atomic blast sequences. I got a little overwhelmed by the imagery at that point and tried to steer the visualization in a calmer direction by turning the screen into a live video of a lava fall (the white noise reminded me of the deafening sound of a large waterfall when you're standing beneath it). The ""X"" eventually came back, but I made it glow with rounded edges to turn it into a butterfly. In this order I saw mathematical equations that were almost Einstein complex, symmetrical honeycombs with tiny cartoon bees in the center, an old black and white 1900's photograph with at least 15 people, mostly females in traditional clothing, a view from inside a fast moving train with lights zooming by almost as if the train was going to derail. I saw a dark, scary abyss that was spiraling towards me, the black growing larger as if I felt like I was spinning. Then the images would repeat again in the same order. At the very end before I clicked off, all 4 corners looked like some sort of vines were growing into the center of the screen, like in the tv show Stranger Things. I saw mathematical equations similar to Einstein's, then switched to symmetrical honeycomb shapes all lined up with somewhat cartoonish bees in the middle of the honeycombs all symmetrical, then switched to a black and white photograph from the 1900's with many women dressed in dress uniforms all standing in rows, then I was inside a train that was in a tunnel with lights outside zooming by fast like the train was going to crash. These images repeated and the final scene which only appeared once at the end of the session after the train was there were these black vine like things that started in all four corners and slowly moved inward towards the middle, similar to the vines in Stranger Things. Then it went black. To begin with, it was just red and black flickering, but as I watched for longer I saw flashes of yellow mix in. And then pink and blue as well. Shapes where constantly morphing and changing. Mostly blank on a coloured background. Around the edge of the screen black lines flicked back a forth (creating the perception of train carriages moving fast in front of you). And occasionally black blobs (mostly circular-ish) moved (constantly changing) over the centre of the screen. Often forming shapes similar to pressing paint between a piece of paper (like the 'butterflies' you make with 3 yr olds).

Through out the whole process, I could reset the shapes and colours (only seeing red and black flashing) by focusing on a point within the screen, but as soon as I let my eye out of concentrated focus other colours and shapes reappeared. I could mainly see shapes and lines rather than proper images but these were persistent after a minute of looking at the Ganzflicker. The lines and shapes also disappeared if I looked directly at them.  I saw different shapes and colours  Shifting, incredibly fast flickering of faces, eyes, mouths, some animals- not much else. It was a bit scary, faces had neutral to unpleasant expressions. They were mostly transparent. I had repeats of the same image spinning in pinwheels around a single point, similar to light psychedelic visuals but with less fluidity/motion and more staccato/jaggedness. The images weren't all the same size & varied by a few centimeters. Each image would appear for just long enough to grasp what it was before my eyes could actually process it and notice detail. Then it would turn into something new. The actual wheel itself would stay in the same place, or drift around slowly, or cut to a new one elsewhere after maybe 15-30 seconds. I had some fingerprint-like spirals and a flashing/electric horizon line in the center of my screen sometimes. More than 1 pinwheel was present sometimes too.

I think my brain wants to see single images but can only project them 100x over. Maybe it thinks I have bug eyes. LOTS OF SPIRALS AND GEOMETRIC SHAPES. THEY FELT LIKE THEY WERE COMING OUT OF THE SCREEN AND I WAS IN A TRANCE LIKE EXPERIENCE.  rapid movement of lines, shapes and circles  lines
triangles
a star shape 
geometric patterns 
a hand 
squiggles 
and the Eiffel tower My imagery was not so much a specific thing, as a cool wave of patterns that i could control with my eye movement.  Waves of motion clockwise, counter clockwise, pulses up and down as i thought about how i wanted them to move.  The flickering was disturbing at first, then very relaxing. 2 closed hands, then a map of europe with weird blue arrows and then strange square-ish things moving 2 point perspective to a blue point, sometimes almost all red, pulsing and lava lamp like movements 2d fractals blending into tunnels with view points changes 2x 3d pyramids stick together, I just googled it, bipyramid. It was spinning and rotating. Blurry bold edges but interior facets were very sharp and distinct. Occasionally I'd see straight lines like I was looking at the inside of a corner of a cube. I saw one instance of a straight rainbow line sort of like I was looking through a prism. 3 horizontal bands across the screen of shifting squiggles on a darker background, blocks of partially outlined in white rectangles with complex squiggle shapes inside which shifted in intensity and squiggle pattern with the flashing of the colors, but which were fairly stable throughout the overall pattern as it cycled through back and red patterns 4 vertical lines   then ~ ~~~~ these looking lines 5 proopeller at the same moment,white,blue,black,yellow colors in the screen 5 sided light green umbrella tops spinning. Another time I saw bubbles, like a diver sees when scuba diving. Another time I was seeing what looked like neutrons forming in the center then exploding out. 50s looking diner to a forest to floating eye balls, to round swirling shapes then an incoming spiral of light being flung around me horizon line, rainbow, grid, moving forward sensation just white / bright circles / ball of lights. kind of like when you're looking into the sun for a while and then close your eyes and just see a bright ball of light  A 3d spinning cog, a space-station like that of 2000 space odyssey a similar, a mario-cart like car and a ship on sea. A ball bouncing and stripes flashing  a ball circled around, first on a wall then on a floor. Then lines danced around between left and right side A ball made of smaller balls rotating in the centre. Dali style tessellations of birds, butterflies and arrows a ball of multi-colored light that moved around. I could move it by moving my eyes around the screen sort of like it followed my vision A big chessboard a bird,  a face that morphed into many faces and a building a bird, a flower, a chessboard, an amusement park ride A bit unpleasant. Burned my eyes afterwards like having an eye test with those drops they use for eye dilation  A black/red alternating grid pattern which shifted in size over time A blinking eye, a road, a snowstorm A bright red oval in the middle with a bright red border around the edges of the screen with flickering and morphing black lines and filaments connecting the two, and occasionally white lines a building in a school, with lots of layers and windows, no roof. A bunch of cosmetic red, black, and beige shapes, rotating eyes, screen tearing, the screen bending, the birdseye view of a city. A bunch of geometric shapes, then the pyramids of giza almost constantly A bunch of spheres and circular imagery that popped in and out rappidly A butterfly emerging from a cocoon. City in the distance. A couple dancing. A worm or snake… can’t think of all of them, but those were the most vivid A carridor with a doorway at the end A cascade of storyboards like images playing out the evolution  of the cosmos. Star birth, black hole transformation, dark matter raising the cosmos.species raise and fall. Stories offered and picked as I went. 

Yes intense and useful tool. A church, a man in hood, an injector, a maple leaf and a bottle. A circle in the middle, lines converging (vertical and diagnol to screen) A circle of darkness in the centre of the image, distinct lines sparking throughout from the centre. In a circle is where the lines shown out, was great! lol A circle of lights spinning and different colors. a circle with lines going to it a city lanscape A coastal area with a castle built on a hillside, a river that ran between two cliffs in a canyon that towered above me, a monster's face, intricaye patterns, a skyscape at night A constant firing geometric landscape, which shifted into a series of tunnels that I was going into. The direction of motion changed. At some points I saw completely different colors like a blue sky with a white disc. In the last few min I used my minds eye to try to imagine I was looking at the corner of a wall which caused the images to shift radically and split the view into two, the left side being organic slow blobs and the right side rapidly rotating geometric patterns.  I had the distinct feeling at multiple times that I was viewing real places. The blinking and red went away completely and I was sailing smoothly over different scenes. A constantly shifting, yet sometimes stagnant rotation of different patterns. sometimes, a cross would form, other times it would seem as if the flicker formed a spiral-like pattern. sometimes it would even look like a checkerboard of red and black. mostly unpleasant to look at, but I don't like red personally. started to strain my eyes after two or so minutes. A continuous visual flow out of two over lapping portals. Everything was evolving so quickly it was hard to keep up with. This must be opening the flood gates to your subconscious. A cross A cross that centers where my eye was looking was persistent the entire time. Meaning 1 column and one row about an inch in size. Many squiggly lines, similar to looking at a bright sky and seeing floaters. But more of them and constant. The most intense object was I started seeing the creases in my pants appear inside the image and it reminded me of a hand which scared me. As soon I realized what it was from, it went away. A dark hallway at first,  then lines, geometric shaoes, pattern, then rotating green A diamond shape in center from a smudge on my screen that radiated as it flashed red and black on the screen.  The edges  of my phones border moved inwars5with each flash. I only watched it for a few moments before stopping.  I didn't listen to the white noise. Just the imagery. A dimension composed purely of spirals. Geometric shapes, some of which had eyes in them which were glowing green. Distortions. Spinning triangles. A dozen or so white beacons would rotate in tandem as if attached to an invisible 3D structure, the occurred a few times in the first 5 minutes and was overlaid on the flashing colors. Constantly saw colors other than red and black. Visual field would be overlaid with a variety of geometry from grids, circles, or blooms. Also would see a small circle of distorted grey ‘smoke’ in the center of my vision if I intentionally looked deeper into the screen as if it were 3D. Have experienced the same thing before encountering hypnagogic imagery. After watching the flicker I closed my eyes and saw a small structure to my right that I couldn’t identify but seemed to be like looking down onto a space as if it were illuminated by moonlight. This faded after 10 seconds and my field was dominated by intertwining transparent green tendrils that had fractal qualities and moved. The smokey distortion was present in the center. Visuals slowly faded after about 3 minutes A dry cracked desert, a man holding somethi g and turning to look at me, a bright street light on a dark street with tall buildings either side, a lions face but like a poster not like a real lion A face  a face apeared and it started to deconstruct itself into the solar system there was a large spiral that overlaid itself over the solar system and the planets started to rotate adhering to the spiral which resembled the number 9 it combined into itself and created the image of a sunset on the ocean then it morphed into a big iron gate and then it morphed back into a face A face slowly lifting its head to up. A lot of eyes everywhere on screen. Eyes making flower like something. I see a pond with a space rocket going up, some stars, it was like a kid's drawing not moving just stars changing. Lines looks like letters or patterns moving around changing everytime. I see a lot of color changes.  A Face, Tunnels, Squares A few blurry faces that never materialized.  A moving subway tunnel or covered roller coaster.  An alien figure.  A sci-fi worm hole and dome space craft.  X was predominant toward the end of time. different colors, moving shadows and lines,  Patterns of what looked like a man's face moving rapidly I was seeing many geometric patterns and several doorways and also arrows and a sun. The colors were blue, purple, pink, yellow, red, black and maybe some green.  started with a star pattern, then went into some lines, overall lots of fractal like images that would either appear and just grow the way fractals do around to the edge of the screen or it would rotate like a wheel in both directions, sometimes going from a flat circle to falling away from me so it would be more oblong, like a tire that fell over.  Reminded me a lot of what I see on the backs of my eyelids sometimes. I noticed that as time went on the pattern of a 5 pointed star became more complicated to something closer to a 12 pointed star. Patterns would be mostly symmetrical, but could move in asymmetrical ways- like if I saw two circle fractally shapes next to each other just outside the center of the screen, one may rotate and the other would fall over and then rotate off screen.  I said I saw other colors, mostly like oranges and the gradient that is between that red and black, so like I said - oranges, but then into browns and such. Flickering rainbows, bright dots like stars rushing past, turning wheels of light, spirals, a spaceship, train tracks, a corridor with a door at the end It started with a pulse, like a speaker center, beating. It then started to turn and the area around started to churn counter clockwise to the beat. This split into two, where each center pulse started to fall deeper into the image, turning both into circling vortexes. The vortexes spun around like each other like a binary star circling, connected at the center giving each other matter to consume.

Moving into the image, it flies forward, around a mountain, into a valley, a town near the river, the river letting into a large lake, the lake deep, going into the lake, going into another vortex.

Moving down on a planet, landing in a forest, seeing the path from wizard of oz. 

Waves crashing, an ocean in a storm. A few times, for a half second or so, I saw images of a large city like Manhattan, but from above the skyscrapers, and very quickly the ""telephoto"" lens zoomed out. Also there were moments of fractal-ish spiderwebs. I wanted those to continue, but they didn't. I realized my mind could make very basic images move left to right and back, up and down. I experimented by blinking my eyes and one thing I thought was weird was an interrupted, blank moment before the mostly red, sometimes black and rarer times blue colors floated around. I wanted it all to be far more trippy, and when it wasn't happening it felt like doing meditation again after not doing it for a long time: too much ""monkey chatter"" but here: too much chaos in visual field. Not enough smooth organization that developed into anything. I'd start to get there...but then I'd be back to where I started. Also: I think I may have had too much caffeine in my system and that might have hindered the advent of psychedelic imagery that I had desired. A figure of a human being moving side to side, flicker of random images A fireball bouncing up and down while surrounded by fractels A forest passing by rapidly, as if I were on a train passing by it. the black shadows took the shape of trees and the red filtered through like setting sunlight. Sometimes the perspective would change and it looked like i was looking up from the forest floor as i rapidly passed under the leaves, or was spinning very quickly while looking up at the sunlit treetops. there was no natural colors, just red light and shadows. A futuristic car slowly leaving a parking lot of a tall glass building a geometric tunnel, that felt as if I was moving into it a green ball of light that moved over the screen, spiderwebs, grids, a large building or fort, a moving car  A grid with red and green colors, different shades of red, like a checkered shirt a group of words/ a phrase that was repeated over several lines; simultaneously there were lightning strikes, balls of light atop a mountain A harbor scene, Woody woodpecker in color, few birds and butterflies, spirals, driving down a road,  A head and body, but no features. A house, trees without leaves "

A'so a cúpula or a gazebo with a round roof. It was sort of a flash, but quite distinctive and sharp. A large grid  A long tunnel opening up in the middle and then ferocious? Scratching all of the screen A lot of blue color, blobs moving around on the screen. A lot of faces wings a flower flowy robe light house clouds green eyes dark eyes birds a very toothy smile of possibly feline or demon  was too brief at one point a heart two dark figures meeting in the middle a bearded man like a wizzard a sad girl big soulful eyes an older woman coming down from left just face whole screen a mans face then clouds again  A lot of geometric patterns, a lot of eyes and moving vehicles, a beach, a fast moving tunnel, train tracks A lot of grids, patterns, swirls, bands of flashes, square and round windows leading onto grass and rocks and sky (like highlands), I could change the rotation at will, occasional screens of pure red or black (maybe once a minute?), dimensional depth (i.e., not constrained to the screen surface), groups of pinpricks of light a lot of it looked like my art? lots of eyes, moving circles, triangles and squares, lots of distorted space-y thing A lot of lines, circles triangles and geometric shapes were dancing on the screen, blinking and distorting, but there were also few shapes that weren't geometrical. I couldn't see clearly what it was, but it was something. A lot of moving spiderweb patterns, waves rippling through the whole thing. It felt like the screen was getting bigger and bigger A lot of patterns, but at one point there was a rotating square, and a vauge face.  A lot of rotation and movement of shapes. Some faces A lot of shapes and patters that pulsated with the white noise. When I turned that off it was like seeing the sea. A lot of blues, greens, teals and the view was being in the water like it was flowing around  A lot of swirling and fluid motion. Like the red was water, seeing drops falling onto its surface and forming currents, eddies, and whirlpools. The whirls would move around the screen and I could track them with my eyes until they reached some distance and seemed to fade. Almost like an actual whirl in water.

I also saw various birds in flight, but only one bird at a time at various distances mostly the silhouettes of the wings flapping and the whole form moving, at times the bird would be flying away from me and the image would shrink into the distance, at others I would be following along behind it in flight.

Also saw rotating geometric shapes almost like starbursts or gears or mandalas. The motion was very fast in rotation, maybe even at or near the speed of the flickering. Although sometimes it would appear to slow, stop, and reverse almost like the effect you see when looking at a spinning car tire. A lot of the time, it seemed like my entire vision would go red instead of just the screen, and I could see flashing yellow and green lights. Most of the time these lights would pulse out from the center, often looking like ripples or spiderwebs. I saw a ladder lying on its side in the center, turning in random directions and spinning. In my periphery, I sometimes saw red or yellow chairs doing much the same. Much of the time, I thought I saw eyes bouncing on the screen, sometimes connected to stalks. the flashing also seemed to slow down quite a bit. A masked human leaning  out from a wall A mishmash of sort of geometric shapes, diagonal squares, intersecting lines, a sort of random pile. A mixture of spirals or lines in black and white moving across the screen and a circular motion. A number of dots that looked like star constellations. Blobs of blue purple and green that looked like the northern lights.  A pair of sunglasses rotating around in 360, they turned into a schoolbus then a planet with rings in a cycle a person rising from a chair in the periphery, a crane stabbing its beak into water, mutating rorschach tangles taking up the entire screen A person walking towards me on a Forest path A person. A woman with a veil over here head. A monster morphing into something.  Winged creature.  A plateau with spiking rock formations, man with a mustache yelling, many people screaming and suffering, a vortex a projector screen showing a summertime sunflower meadow in full color A pyramid with a ball of light on top. A hallway moving. Numbers. Shapes.  A pyramid
A shining jewel turning into the sun
A tunnel like 2001 space odissey
A pair of female eyes staring at me
A chess pattern a rainbow centipede, archways to a building, a canopy of trees looking up from below, a sea of people walking in the same direction, a person falling, etc.  A rainbow of colors, but I couldn't quite say what the colors were. They were all mixed together and changed really fast. Sometimes saw circular geometric shapes that looked like fractals but they were mild. The right side of my screen looked like it was stretching past where the screen actually was. A red centre revolving rapidly with blue and red whirlpool spirals rotating very quickly.  The red centre changed to yellow and deminished before returning to a larger size and disappearing . a red worm edges towards the viewer, also saw the screen at one point as a black and white chessboard, from top view. with the red suqers leaking vains like dry paint. into the black squers. tunnels from one point to another, in a squer form and round, like rings. 

the feeling of seeing this reminds me of going to sleep, its the same feeling, when i go to sleep, my brain goes into a sort of overdrive, and i seen random mental pictures thats very real, 2/5 pics per second, its very fast, and they often have no connection, like flowers made of crystals, turns into a therter of the 2 old grumpy men from muppets, turns into a rotating moon made of water that spinds so fast that it releashes the water, that turns into frongs. personal note, i have never done drugs in anyform. and i am of sounds health. but, when seeing the black/red. its the same feeling, of that fast paced images, only with way less images. A rocket zooming from the bottom of the screen. A space ship moving from the right side of the screen with a trail of white light following it to the left top part of the screen, another small burst of movement as well from the centre of the screen. And a mixture of different types of movement at the corners. A rolling soccer ball, a leaopards face, a butterfly, a cube, someone doing jumping jacks, an alarm clock, a tiger  A room with a window; a hand crashing a sphere; parts of human bodies; lightenings A sensation and image of being underwater and looking up at the sun or another light from about 6 feet below the surface, everything distorted in weird ways as if looking through a liquid.  Squares and triangles rotating, expanding out into more squares and triangles, lines sliding across the screen. A sense of deepness, like a tunnel with a light at the end, or the same as when you close your eyes when going on a car because the intensity of the light is too much and you see the shadows of the trees as black figures alternating with the redness of the blood in your eyelids. 
Sometimes the figures remember me of the nightmares I used to have as a child, a ball without a definite form made of geometrical shapes always changing, messing into one another. Sometimes the shapes were linear in various changing degrees, sometimes were spiraled, always towards the center of the image. Sometimes they were pulses like heartbeats, in this case, some blue colors were merging with the black and red.  a series of faces surrounded by different patterns; the surrounding patterns started to place in my brain as positive or negative....some felt happy and some felt sad or angry A series of four pointed starbursts aligned in a row that rotated about a center axis. They varied in number from a few to a line stretching the length of the image. The color changed from red to a more peach tone. There were several sequences where the colors gave the impression of rotational movement. That is, it gave the impression that I was on the inside of a rotating cylinder. A series of scenes filling the view port, consisting of fractal patterns and geometric shapes layering over and through each other, all moving with different speeds, rotations, and directions. Each scene lasted a couple of flickers before being replaced by a completely new scene. Everything appears 2 dimensional, but some aspects show perspective hints, such as a row of 5 pointed stars along the bottom of the screen that were distorted as if they were supposed to be tilted into the screen, but still appeared flat. A shifting of black and red patterns and senses of movement, mostly spinning or rotating, some lateral drifting. It reminded me of looking at the back of my eyelids and seeing vague shapes. a single landscape, mostly scanning lines, blocks moving, vertical lines moving, circles and spirals, colors like blue and yellow and green, fractals, all of this morphing continuously. Screen movement like it was wobbling either side to side, or around in circles. Audio White noise, i heard what sounded like people talking, ambient outside noises, music, hums... real enough to make me wonder if it was put into the track. a spider web with a triangle in the middle a spinning wheel animation(?) for a second A spinning wheel spinning in all possible angles A spiral galaxy that would spin counter clockwise and flip over slowly while still spinning A spiral illustration, and it just went down inside a spiral, a pyramid, a butterfly, a flying disc/UFO A square at the centre of the screen. Lines going diagonal thou it. A small dot was in the center of the square. A surreal sense of altered consciousness where my surrounds fell away. I started to see blue fractals flowing across the screen and into one another, like some kind of living thing A swirling circle a x moving through the screen A tornado,a body,spirils,orbs,squares  ,triangles,boxes,circles a trainway where ı were moving too fast in the train and looking at the trainway on the floor.two-pendulum with moving according to lagrangian mechanics.A smiling emoji.Rotating spheres.A two rectangle sperated from each other by a vertical line which creates two rectangule from my screen and the boundry were moving right to left and then left to right.Water waveforms spreading from the source.Sİnce I have OCD I use olanzapin 5mg antipsychotic can that mediceni affected my experience please research about this subject and if possible publish a article in a journal. I am really interested in this subject after experiencing this. a tree, many rainbows, flashes of light and colors.  a tunnel (appeared to ascend into the tunnel) a tunnel for a subway or water. patterned concret walls.  A tunnel. But the tunnel began expanding, followed by fans of lasers converging to a point, and I could control the point. Then animals, specifically a tiger, vivid bright eyes that seemed to be staring directly at me. Then idk, the universe, space, some massive expanse of what looked like stars, swirling and rotating as if I was moving with great speed in it, a central point of rotation that was void of light or experience. More tunnels, tunnels that would expand rapidly back to the swirling universe, it felt massive and unending, shockingly real and deep. Like I was moving through it. I have a headache now as well. A tunnel. Fractal shapes. The tunnel exit kept moving around. As if the tunnel was winding. I seemed to ""break through"" steps or barriers to get deeper. I could see fractal strips lining the tunnel all going the same direction. I felt (a few times) a sense or instinct that something was not ok. Thought a few times that I had seen the word ""NO"" afterwards. A Vertical sound wave with curly ""strings"" in the peripherals A very exaggerated waveform slowly morphing. Images continually changed into a tunnel. Detail continued to get higher the longer the experiment went on. WIll try again in an undisturnbed quiet session. Curious if the noise sample affects the visual experience. A vortex/ kaleidoscope spinning an morphing in size and shapes that came out of the phone. Mainly red and white but saw as little blue and black and green. A whirling shape varying wildly in complexity, sometime 2 whirling shapes at the same time. Many times giving the illusion of travelling through a spinning tunnel usually circular but occasionally through a spinning sea of cubes. Interspersed were periods of seeing various gridded geometric shapes usually spinning around a point outside the screen. Whenever I would blink I would see rainbow static tending towards darker shades. A white Angel in a sort of long white cloak and large white wings  A white person outline walking across the screen A woman About 40% It's feels as if it's fading, in a dreamlike pattern, on awakening. abstract imagery mostly composed of thin black lines on orange & red background, in constant fast movement:  rushing toward me, rushing away into a tunnel, from left to right (NEVER right to left), diagonally and in a spinning motion like a wheel.  Also some shadowy shapes rushing from left to right, white/pale yellow flame shapes like movie gunfire coming towards me.  There was also a white 'snowy' flicker around the outside of the image area, like a television screen without reception. After 1 or 2 minutes I started seeing colors, at first it looked like an unrecognizable object is starting to form, but then it turned into rainbow-colored straight lines, always at an angle of about 45 degrees. These lines were at most 1cm thick, divided into 3-5 strips of different colors of the rainbow. At some point I came very close to the screen (5-10 cm away) and looked through into the distance, I noticed a dirty spot on the screen, and it looked like it was just hanging in the air as if I could pick it with my fingers without touching the screen, as if the screen was at least a little bit further away than this dirty spot. When slowly and smoothly moving away from the screen, I suddenly noticed all the dirty spot on my screen, for some reason they just stood out and were very visible (black on the red background). Most of the time nothing happened except for the rainbows which were pretty common. After 1-2mins I started seeing geometric patterns.  I then saw a complex pattern that appeared to be in a loop, and after about another min of this loop that originated in the center, the pattern changed into almost like a clock shape and started rotating like the face of a clock.  I started seeing objects pop up around the image that were not part of the pattern then.  Eyes started to appear out of it, and then I kept seeing two faces, once on the left side that looked like a skeleton head while the other appeared like a meatier face - the faces were looking at each other not me. The faces then merged into a new geometric pattern, and I saw the faces an additional time, exactly like the first time, again as if they were in a pattern. Near the final minute the patterns were getting to be the most intense, and I was starting to feel the most unpleasant.  I was watching with my wife and she got a headache and I felt sick to my stomach.  I did not have any auditory events. After a couple seconds there were patterns of shapes, constantly morphing into different shapes/patterns. After a minute or two more complex images began to emerge. A bird's eye, isometric view of blocky buildings/towns, almost like a map from a video game, was one of the first ones. Then it was like flying through a cityscape passing between buildings. At one point almost made out human like shapes. Then more patterns and constantly morphing shapes. After a couple seconds, blurry face/skull-like shapes appeared in the periphery and the center had blue spots a little more left of center and felt (but did not look specifically) like a monster face. It felt like the faces were approaching and attacking and was extremely uncomfortable. after a few seconds I saw glitter in the centre, then a few minutes I saw lazers, that spun, protruded and twisted through rain - sun rise shapes (not detailed representation of  real sunrise) and red bubbles expanding and overlapping, then circles and cogs behaving as if in a kaleidoscope - then the colour green in stripes or ripples  - the glitter had gone , and the green went too, but then I saw an Iris in gold and red (eye not flower) and the Iris alternated between being an Iris, or lazers and then settled on being the tunnel or tube described above; the journey through the tube was exhilarating and the passage would one moment be straight and the next curving and also I could sometimes alternate perspective to see the tube spinning around me as I travelled along it. After a while i started to saw black as blue. And it got lighter as time passed. It seemed like the monitor screen was getting bigger for a minute or so. Also sometimes i thought like the white noise was following the colors change order. Like it was changing its frequency when it's red and normal again when it's black (or blue sometimes i saw it as). Also when red appeares i felt like my eyelids extended (like opened). And they got closed a little bit when it was black again. After half way true it started to happen the exact opposite. My eyelids closed a little bit when it was red and extended when it was black (blue). My nose was itching but i didn't wanted to scratch it. After minutes i felt like my nose was bleeding but still didn't touch it. I scratch it after the Ganzflicker and it wasn't bleeding nor it was a runny nose. And finally probably because of i didn't blink my eye for too long, i had few tears falling thru my right eye. This was my experience. I didn't see any complex objects or environments. After 10 minutes of Ganzflicker i looked at my environments but everything was looking normal. after about a minute a nebulous greyish cloudlike pattern appeared over the entire screen like an overcast cloudy sky.  after another two minutes a brightish weblike pattern appeared over the entire screen. this persisted for 1 to 2 minutes then disappeared and appeared again in the same manner 2 or 3 times during the first 5 minutes.  after 1 or 2 minutes a fuzzy yellow ring occupying about 20% of the screen appeared at the center top of the screen which persisted the entire time.  after about 5 minutes the central portion of the screen began faintly swirling in a counterclockwise direction.  this swirling persisted for about 3 minutes and would change direction. after the swirling the image began to throb across the entire width of the screen in a top to bottom direction, protruding more as it reached the bottom of the screen. then the white noise ended (10 minutes) and i stopped. After about five minutes the colors started changing to orange, yellow, red.  I saw faint spiderweb type images, but that could have been my blood vessels in my eyes.  after awhile my eyes kept moving the screen around/rotating it, it definitely didnt look still anymore  After awhile my eyes would lose focus, where sometimes I'd get faint lightning bolt type lines on the screen. They'd normally be white-blue and would stay for a few seconds, maybe moving or rotating slightly. I might occasionally see a small lighter spot or almost snow/static, both of which would be a whitish-bluish color. All of it was quite simple and quite faint, and would disappear back into the red/black after a moment. Aliens, voodoo man in top hat, bricks, woman, vlad the impaler, many men's faces, colors red, orange, pink, green, blue, black All abstract shapes, more white when paying attention All I saw for sure was that the blackish bluish or lighter reds would make balls or boxes or lines, moving across the screen, but I had the constant sense that quick flashes were people's faces that were going by too fast for me to really make them out All of the images appeared to be the red color outlined in static.  First I saw a nazi symbol which morphed into a heart then into the letter ""G"".  Then I saw a tunnel, green stars, a heart-shaped tunnel...a realistic human eye popped up in the top right corner for a few seconds then disappeared, then the other eye came up in the left middle screen, that's when the image started to shift downward. Every time I blinked, it would be back in the normal position but them slowly slide down.  That's when I stopped the image by hitting the back button on my phone. All of the patterns I saw were constantly rotating or moving in a circular motion.  I saw images that looked like targets/bullseyes, spirals, snail shell-like patterns, and lines.  The target images moved in circular motions around the screen, and the others rotated, or moved and rotated.  I also saw a black border on the edges of the screen that would pulse.  The target images also made me jump in fright when they appeared, as if they were going to come at me. all sorts of patterns/shapes ands motions to them  Almost a perfect 45 degree light fractured into streams and rays and then colours from red purple white.  Throbbing and changed in colour slowly. Almost angry complex geometrical shapes around the edges with a lot of tiny white dots of light going in a circle; first in one direction the the other. Then a flash of a wolf     And then back to shapes and dots for a bit then a flash of a different wolf.  Almost like that computer program that tries to make images out of nothing and reminds me of tripping on acid. Shapes morphing into other shapes and objects. Almost like thick spiderweb. Geographic picture Almost like traveling through a wormhole. almost nothing .it was just hurting my eyes because of that there was dark shadows Almost the entire 10 minutes the screen looked like old film was running, complete with flickering grain, light leak, scratches, and wandering alignment.
The ghostly lines and shapes I saw were jerkily animated--a butterfly fluttering across the screen, a huge waterfall, a crawfish. I was disappointed that I didn't see any clear or strong images. Almost the whole experience had a sense of moving backgrounds, like a drone flying around an environment. Sometimes it would be steady and sort of ""fly over the environment"", other times it would move/rotate around complexly (it did not feel like I was a drone, I am instead trying to describe the movement of my ""vision"" of the backgrounds).

Occasionally I would see a human figure, but it never resolved into anything particularly vivid.

There were a number of times it felt like I could very vividly see a human face (not attached to the figures described above), but it would melt fairly rapidly into a moving background.

Lots of the more vivid experience felt like natural objects; trees, oceans, forests, rivers, etc. Occasionally something more man-made would emerge, but a majority of the experience looked ""natural"". alternatiing patches of ""balls"" moving inward Alternating red and black, turning red and blue, then blotches of yellow in the red. Blue ightening in colour. Am Anfang blaues Flackern, blaue Spiralen, wurden zu Schneckenhäusern, Fluss mit Strudeln erst in blau, dann weiß und Regenbogenfarben, Fluss floss erst nach links, dann nach rechts, immer schneller, Autoreifen, die sich abwechselnd in beide Richtungen drehten, erst alles blau, später auch gelb, Feuer mit Funken, Zacken an Bildschirmrändern, Meereswellen die auf mich zu kamen, Sonne über dem Meer und glitzern auf dem Wasser, vage ein blaues Pferd das schnell durchs Bild galoppierte Amorphous grey shapes, slow moving.  Better one eye at a time. An ""X"" like pattern in the middle.  Movement of black lines as if it were a tire rotating.  A chess board pattern in the middle (almost 3D).  A pin point in the middle rotating in a circular pattern.  The Black colors were mostly at the top or to the left and the light orange at the bottom An angel or winged being which flapped it’s wings once very slowly and gracefully. A tubular object rotating slowly. Blasts of fire.  An elephant with a raised trunk An evil smiling man that turned into someone dribbling a basketball, but then the ball got away from him and he started chasing after it. The ball would bounce around the screen like a screen saver on the tv. An eye, monkey and cobra an image that reminded me of an ancient carved image, like a Mayan carving, then brief glimpses of a mountain lake at night - lots of dark blue with faint images of trees, water and sky. An old caregiver friend and lots of shapes"

The X split into six arms at one point then back to four. Sometimes it shattered into something of a grid, though in diamonds rather than squares. The diamonds shattered more and began to spin in place. If I retained this focused-unfocused state long enough, I saw blue spiral arms in the background, similar to a spiral galaxy but only the arms in a single line of points like stars. At this point I would lose focus and go back to the X. I tried for 1-2 minutes, but it became very uncomfortable to watch. It took several attempts at starting to get that far. An x, a cross, a dotted square area, weird patterns of blue and yellow after several minutes Angry gorilla face animals like monkeys, eyes, stars, a neon pulsing heart, buildings, cityscape, patterns, circular whizzy things overlapping animated shapes that spun and moved around the page. Some of them were emitting light.  anime cartoons Anime moment apples, drills, forest, train, tunnel, picture frames, targets,  orange ... Arrow, rotating sky, a short building arrows, circles, diamonds/stars/geometric shapes, trails, blue block colour, expansion/contraction, eyes/schematic faces, swirly lolly waving back and forth Arrows, swirls, pulsating near center of screen As I was staring into it for some reason the story reminded me of Alice in Wonderland I couldn't quite see the characters face but it was like a black and white cartoon that was flickering somewhere to those in the early '90s maybe the eighties and there was no audio but my head was trying to put together the story. The first she was running towards something then she was running away but then she got blown back towards whatever she was running away from will need to realize she wasn't running away from anything it's quite hard to explain. She also was in like a forested area As if my screen had wrinkles permeating from the edges, as well as crosshatched black patterns in the middle of the screen As mentioned above: all kinds of things but mostly rotating objects and tunnel flights -- often including fractal patterns & structures. The most similar thing I've seen in real life are the demos / renderings on pouet.net. If you really insist on concrete examples: craters on a rotating curved plane from above (not top down though); gear-like interlocking and rotating objects; Rotating turbines, galaxies & strange attractors; view into a gorge with symmetrical waterfalls; bubbly/pebbly caverns; lens flares & sawblades. There was a lot more -- the more I look the more I see. The variation in imagery is very high. As soon as I made the image full screen I started to see hundreds or thousands of geometric shapes (triangles, circles, indescribable others) wriggling around and over each other, vibrating. They tended to stay in a sort of grid formation, leaving empty spots where there weren't any, though as soon as I tried to focus on those places the grid shifted, keeping the empty spots out of focus. This morphed back and forth for a while into and from a large whitish ball in the center of the screen. When I started to relax my eyes and hit a meditative sort of space, I saw clouds, from above, very vividly. They then morphed into a sort of complex scene where I saw trees turn into the ocean, with the beach in front of it, and the sky above it. The clouds were fluffy and white, typical cumulostratus, but sort of endless. The trees were more of an impression of a massive pine forest, their geometry and (feeling?) more so than their colors. The sky over the beach was exceptionally blue, and the beach was very white. Whenever I blinked, I saw a fractal tube extending from the center of the screen beyond its edges, shifting like a kaleidoscope. As soon as I started watching, squares and rectangles appeared, and after a while, purple squares appeared. Finally, the plague doctor was on the screen, the image was gray. As stated,a hallway. No doors, just an endless hallway As the screen flickered at first I saw nothing. Then as my eyes relaxed I began to retain after-images of each flash. After about a minute of relaxing these after-images began to take shape into various patterns, almost like the audio visualizers on the old Windows Media Player only the images were always monochromatic (though that singular color would shift within the red/yellow spectrum as I gazed). These patterns would pulse and move/shake with a sort of rhythm before either fading back into nothingness or turning into something else. In the most intense moments, the imagery started as shapes but turned into moving images that felt like flip books. One appeared to be a first-person perspective moving forward along the wires of some bridge high in the air, and another seemed to be hurtling past stars. No other explicit imagery comes to mind, though a feeling of forward motion was a constant after the first few seconds. Whenever my eyes would get dry or tired, however (as I wear contact lenses), they would refocus and the image would disappear and a new one would begin as my eyes relaxed again. As well as red and black I saw orange, yellow and green,  I saw shadows in the corners of the screen and vein and spot like patterns which moved when my eyes moved, so it felt like looking into the back of my eye.  Occasionally, the dots briefly appeared in a diagonal line At about 5 mins in, it seemed to take on a sort of radiating, as if the flickering were emerging from the center of the screen out. Toward the end, I started to see whitish waves moving along the bottom of the screen. Also, as I mentioned, there were a few times where, for a few seconds, the black flicker was almost imperceptible. At those times, it was almost as if the screen were a static red. At about the 2 minute mark I began to see warping lines and spirals. The black was moving through a gradient of purple and blue while the red stayed vivid. Most shapes were abstract in form with no true cohesive pattern.
By the end they were all over the place, so much so that it was hard to focus as my vision began to tunnel. My eyes believed I was being pulled into the screen until the white noise track stopped abruptly. At bottom saw checke board.  Peripheral area saw green that turns into cloudy t tree 🎄 at first  there was a little bit of noise but then particles appeared and it was like galaxy moving around and there was also circles moving around too i remember them to be a little bit black but overall it wasn't that vivid it's a little like what i would see when i close my eyes and have a little pressure on them. At first a black and red flicker, then various patterns of shapes began to emerge and pulsate. The colors changed to yellow/white/orange with the pulsating shapes patterns and specks of blue and green patterns emerging. At some points the entire screen looked like it was moving around drawing itself as it moved about. At other points it looked like moving through a 3D tunnel and road still in the same colors not real world colors, like a video game almost. Then around the nine/ten minute mark the screen went completely black but the patterns and shapes continued very vividly emerging almost out of the edges of the screen for a few moments and it looked almost like I was standing inside my eyes looking out before I realized the screen had turned off. At that point I clicked the track pad to wake up the computer and saw the red and black flicker again which almost immediately started pulsating with patterns of shapes again while I watched for about another minute or so before turning it off. At first a large circle, then more circles, 2 or 3 at a time, all filled in with geometric shapes, resembling circular stained glass windows, wheel-like with “spokes” that rotated slowly at first then got faster. Later I saw a large female eye and it changed shape appearing and disappearing in various places on the screen; soon whole women’s faces appeared—all about the same age 20 to 30 and pretty. At first a saw laser like lines across the screen but after a few minutes of letting my eyes rest on no part in particular I started to see flowers like in a meadow and then a flowing river through it. At first all I saw was beams of light flashing all over the screen, then eventually, I felt like I was being sucked in. Next thing I knew, I was in the grass looking up at a blood moon over silhouettes of trees. A rainbow shot down from the sky, one color at a time, and wrapped me up in it forcing me to ride the rainbow. It took me into space where my eyes had to adjust to the view, before it took me to the red moon. On the moon, I saw a weird penguin with a duck bill wearing a crown sitting on the sparkly dust. I walked towards him, but we were both sucked into this sand vortex. From there, I fell back through space and landed on the grass from which I came. at first colors were sweeping around, then it seemed like a blue sky background that persisted with red splashes washing over it obscuring the blue background. It seemed for a while like there was a small, maybe one inch, area where words or text might have been obscured or covered over, not quite blanked out. This like faded spot like text incompletely deleted moved around wherever I looked. I didn't see anything else except the sweeping colors mixed with red, splashing and covering the blue sky-type background. Otherwise no images, not even the kind of patterns and shifting clouds I can imagine with my eyes closed. At first cubes, like an mc escher sketch. Then a face like an anime girls face.  It seemed to pop out of the screen. At first flashing circles of light in white, green, and grey with occasional flashes of yellow, purple, and blue. Then light trails of the same colors shooting diagonally from from the lower edge of the screen. Then it looked/felt like I was below a surface (like underwater)), looking up and the trails of light were bursting onto the surface. Then I found myself rising up and into the courtyard of a Chinese palace, similar to The Forbidden City in Beijing, but with a countryside on two sides. It all looked semi-cartoonish, semi-realistic. A sumo wrestler in traditional sumo grab, but with the addition of an open silk robe in red and gold, slowly approached the center of the courtyard. He walked, half-crouched in a ceremonial fashion, first stomping down with one foot, then the other. Each time he stomped his foot down, the whole scene shook and vibrated with it. When he got to the center, he crashed his fists together, then shook them up towards the sky, emitting a fierce yell. A petite young woman in blue and black geisha clothing and makeup came and stood before him, they conversed and argued. He enfolded her in his arms as a second, similar sumo wrestler came up and body slammed his chest to the first one with the woman between them, causing her to shoot straight up into the air, spinning as she did. As she began to spin back down her clothing turned into butterfly-like wings which cut the two wrestlers into silk ribbons that spiraled up in the wind from her wings. The clouds were roiling as the sky darkened and the wind began to blow. 
Then the white noise stopped, abruptly bringing me back. At first I kept seeing a single eye moving up away from the screen. Happened over and over. Each eye was slightly different than the rest. Different sizes sometimes . No colors. The last minute after I put the computer up because looking down hurt my neck I started to look at the bigger picture instead of focusing on just the middle of the screen. I saw planets in space  and different scenes of solar systems rotating, perhaps space stations. Those may have been in colors orange and blue, some yellow. When I looked at them more, they disappeared and a new one came within a second. No eyes during this last minute. at first I saw a bridge in the air with golden sunlight behind it and a fresh blue water fall running under it  and then it vanished and all I saw was shapes and geometric lines but at times it seemed as if a woman in a white dress was approaching me or standing next to me in my peripheral view  at first I saw a forest with many branches and twigs, then a highway, then a farming field At first I saw a fractal with 4 beams, splitting infinitely like a Barnsley fern, for about 1 minute. Then it saw it morph into single line which floated on the screen, changing between straight and slightly arch-curved, for 30 seconds. Then the line disappeared, and I saw faint square tunnel in which I flied forward. Tunnel was curving randomly. I saw the tunnel for about 3 to 4 minutes and then turned Ganzflicker off. At first I saw a red silhouette outline of what I thought looked like a bust of Jesus Christ, but after just a few seconds, the image morphed into a red, medium-sized, wide-open, feminine human eye. the eye looked like a very realistic 3D tattoo drawing, and it gazed straight at me, like it was surprised to be in the Ganzflicker, and mostly stayed in the center of the screen. 

at one point, the eye moved toward the left and trailed behind it a chain of replicated eyeballs that then moved left to right continuously across the screen for about a minute before there was, suddenly, just the one eyeball again.

There were other colors running like liquid in and out of the flashing background, mostly pink triangles or a yellow liquid sheen of catching a light run outward on the from the center along the lines of a rising sun pattern. at first i saw a smile that was drawn aggressively, then a house on a field with a monster on top repeatedly popping up that was trying to escape the screen and get to me. then back to the house alone on the field with smaller houses surrounding it.  then i saw old fashion cartoons from 1950's like mickey mouse and stuff like that in the street. then it became a huge face that began to laugh that started laughing harder and harder by the second and became so big it swallowed the screen. five minutes from the begining of starting the screen had an 'aura' around it At first I saw circles/bubbles forming, then vertical and horizontal lines shooting back and forth, last I saw fast turning wagon wheels appear centered on the left and then on the right side of the screen. At first I saw fast waves that looked like the ocean crashing on the shore in my peripheral vision. Then it changed into a single pine tree in the center of the screen. Next it was as if I was looking into a pipe or tunnel. Each image was quickly changed after a few seconds. At first I saw grid lines appear and morph into a kaleidoscope of different shapes and colors. Then different colors emerged from the periphery and morphed into different colors approaching the center of the screen. Different shapes emerged morphing into faces and animals all alternating at random.  At first I saw shapes moving in and out. Circles, like bubbles, went around in non-geometric patterns. Sometimes I felt enveloped by tunnels. Towards the end I saw a pyramid, a racecar going along the track (it reminded me of my computer wallpaper, which is the 1966 photo finish at Le Mans, except this time there was only one car and it looked of prewar make. Just as the car morphed into a sort of spire or tree, the time was up. AT first I saw shapes swirling in regular patterns around the screen.  Then I started seeing tunnels that I was moving into.  At one point it looked like I was going to crash into the moon.  And last it was though I were driving on a mountain road with a forest around, going through a tunnel every now and again.  Sometimes close up, sometimes as though I were watching from a helicopter. At first I saw simple shapes, but as time progressed I saw more complicated shapes, that took on increasingly complex dimensionally until they became faces, animals, forests, caves, solar systems, black holes, and shooting stars. At one point it shifted into a continuos experience, where I felt like I was hurtling through a guided tour of outer space and time.  At first I saw slanted lines crossing the screen going from left to right and then reversing direction. After awhile the lines seemed to start swirling more like water before spiraling at the center before birthing a lotus in a bond slowly blooming. The lotus remained at the center and the 'water' began to swirl in front of it before flowing into an infinity symbol before the water seemed to become flame and surround the lotus. Then everything faded and my eyes began to hurt so after a few more minutes I shut it off lasting about 6 minutes total. The imagery started maybe a minute or so in. Outside of that there was the occasional diamond grid pattern when my eyes were starting to hurt more. At first I saw spiral galaxies and starfields, then I was floating through massive cylindrical tunnels with rows of glowing windows. It looked like I was constantly moving through the space, curving around corners until I'd come up against a wall of intricate metal spokes that were slowly rotating. Then the image would disappear and reappear, with a different perspective of the same tunnel. I occasionally caught glimpses of spidery-looking plants inside the windows, but mostly they were an indistinct glow. At first i saw what looked like a top down view of stone paths like you would see in garden then these stones began to morph into pillars. I looked away and when i looked back I saw a pair of eyes looking at me blinking occasionally. The eyes would appear where every i looked on the screen and after several seconds of this additional sets of eyes began to appear as well and these eys took on a blue color. I looked away again and when i looked back i saw castles and large buildings some post modern in design. Then i clicked away. At first I thought I could see lines of bold but fuzzy text flashing but this ended quickly. I only saw the flashing light spiraling and swirling emanating from a small brighter circle near the center top of the screen. The spiraling switched between a line moving outward from the center and like it was a whole picture spinning or what I would see if I were looking up while spinning. The imagery reminded me of a newspaper spinning towards the screen in a movie or a slowly rotating shot zooming into a landscape from above. It was only after 10 minutes that I began to see more complex geometric patterns. Each pattern lasted less than a second and would change or disappear if I moved my eyes  or blinked. They were all geometric shapes and patterns never organic or circular. Most were hexagonal.  I kept expecting the blur-y blinking light to clear into an image but they never really did. I saw inky blue patches among the red. Then the red seemed paler and became a bold yellow and the blue became bluer. The darker colours never made it to the edge of the screen. This occurred most often when I relaxed my eyes and the screen seemed to be changing shape; becoming smaller, larger, more square etc.  At one point the patterns looked like (in the center third of the screen) moving speedily past rows of box shaped florescent lights while traveling through a tunnel (or the patient's perspective being wheeling into surgery in a movie). For a moment I also seemed to be looking through hexagonal chicken wire into a dark landscape but no landscape emerged. At first i was just lights but then it felt as if i'm traveling, going upwards and then changing directions, there were patterns of blue and deep green colors, I saw a waterfall and stones where water was hitting and trees, just their silhouette -- of leaves and then there were patterns again At first it did not show much of anything... then the shapes started. Shapes flowed around the screen. I was in a tunnel, like a dark tunnel, with lights along the road and roof. It morphed into an explosion of geometric shapes, turned into planets. I saw faces peering back at me before turning into tigers. A cityscape appeared in the distance lit as an outline with a burst of setting sun. When I looked away my vision blurred for a bit, for a few seconds everything had a trail to it.  At first it looked like a tree in the center, like there was an environment behind a red misty screen. Then it looked like a partially open eye that then closed after a few seconds. Nothing for a bit, then it looked like space behind a red misty screen. There looked like vortexes most of the time or like space itself was spinning. Not much else than that. At first it looked like grids but then it started to look, like a cityscape, the silhouette of buildings  At first it started with 4d geometry, spheres within other spheres or lazer curves then it turned into malign looking faces, during an interval i was experiencing ganzflicker as red, blue and yellow; I also shut my eyes at times to see from within. Later the corridor or mirrored aliens appeared :))

(edit. hmm also before the corridor the 4d geometry formed outside of screen... rotating planets) At first it was a sense of flashing white lights. This became white lightning bolts, very clearly lightning. At times this became lines of flashing white circles as if lightbulbs were illuminating in a pattern one after the other along a line. Multiples were on the screen at once. They traveled a different path than the lightning. There was a few times it seemed like a spaceship type object was floating around the screen amidst the lightning bolts. A flying saucer type -- oval body with spheres set into it. No real detail just the blobby form. Once I felt myself being pulled into the screen and felt fear. I had a sense that I equate with sleep paralysis, like if I let myself give in and, in this case, stare at the dark object in the center of the screen that it was going to hypnotize me or knock me out. This sensation made me pull back and move my focus around the screen while thinking about how I am just watching a flashing light on the screen and nothing physical could actually happen or entity could interact with me. Interesting experiment. At first it was almost like I was in a forest clearing at night and then it switched to a grave-yard i think in that same forest then it switched back to black-red but really fast and it almost appeared to be swirling then i felt like i was watching the red-black screen in a movie theater with some faint images of a movie on it.  At first it was diamond shapes, squares, rectangles. Then the shapes started having layers that pushed off the screen. Then from behind the shapes a bald man appeared, just the head and torso, and as he would get closer he would randomly hunch over. Then he got so close he would bend out of the screen a bit. All while I heard water droplets, but the drop sounded like a heavier liquid than water. At first it was just a flashing red and black but a second or two after I switched to full screen I saw something that was like a ball of light moving around the screen and as I followed it I noticed it was actually surrounded by spinning rings of other balls of light which in increasing layers created a feeling of a wormhole similar to what you might have seen in Stargate TV series. Later it has disappeared and images of X shaped (power lines?) with light flickering across the lines as it was spinning, expanding and subtracting back and forth. I also saw something similar to black hole accretion disc as if I was orbiting around it as it devoured a star leaving a white light trail in a spiral formation. Sides of the screen covered in various size triangles as if it was a cut-out picture frame. At first it was just a pulse in the red/black flashes, then it seemed to move across the screen like a sign wave, then started moving from the outside in and taking on shapes that changed, like a morphing inkblot test. nothing too complex, and never more than a couple of seconds. if I blinked rapidly a few times it was like resetting back to the sign wave portion and would progress again from there.  At first it was kind of intangible swirling of various patterns and shapes. Eventually some things seem to become a bit clearer. The thing I recall the most vividly is at one point it was as if I was staring up at a menacingly bright red sun, bursting through clouds; but it looked like it was in a comic book. at first it was like a kaleidoscope and then turned into faces, shapes, and whatnot all over the screen at first it was like little windows into anchor world dotted around the screen. 
then it became full sized image looking out the window of a car, the car vintage the scenery was rural, yellow grass and large bare patches 
then I was looking at a river close up it was dark and reflecting the sky and I could the the ripples
then the imagery started changing faster, and becoming more detailed I saw
galaxies, space battles, troops shoot laser weapons with a red spiral galaxy in the background 
I saw a man on a platform spinning he had a cap and big hat, he raised his hand and on the palm was the red spiral galaxy and it felt like I fell into it and then I could see fleets of star ships and then it became to fast to remember what happened. At first it was like looking at a kaleidescope - little dots of color change. Then overall color change to blues and greens. Then geometric shapes at the bottom left - triangular/starlike moving slowly toward the center, also sliding right. These shapes morphed into lines, like poorly drawn tunnel. Color shifted back to red. The entire image seemed to be moving horizontally - like  being on a boat, or rocked by waves. There were poorly outlined images of people, or tall rocks - as well defined as a cloud would be - in yellow. The background was really ""fast"" moving really quickly like a speed racer animation horizontally almost coming toward me. I decided to stop.  At first it was like someone's arm came down across the screen, hugging it from inside out. Then that faded, fortunately, and it just became a series of patterns that were dancing and moving and changing. The main colors were black and red but I did see some green and white as well. Possibly some bright bright teal in certain spots. It became unbearable and uncomfortable and I had to stop.  At first it was roughly the shape of a person, then it morphed into a checkered pattern, then diagonal lines across the screen, and out of nowhere what looked like a blue and orange dragon, though it seemed more 2d than 3d, it then started showing flowers, and eventually landed back at vague, humanoid shapes. The only image with color was the dragon that lasted about a minute. At first it was slightly unpleasant, but I think that might have been because my eyes were adjusting to the lower light conditions as I turned off the lights to do this. So at first I didn't see much. But as I relaxed I saw patterns. Swirling that was clockwise in direction. I saw lots of dots swirling, first small then bigger. 

At one time the patterns formed into what looks like a big caterpillar crawling across the screen, but I wouldn't say it was definitely a caterpillar, more of a pattern/swirl that looked somewhat like a caterpillar. 

I found half way through that I could blink rapidly and I would see either the red or the black flash, and if I blinked with the right frequency I would see only black or only red for a few seconds. After doing this for a few seconds it seemed that the patterns would start after being gone for a minute or so, or would appear more vivid. At first just patterns like grids and squares. Further on the surface seemed like it was being struck by rain drops. The screen would seem like a lake view with dark water reflecting red trees and from there to morphing into galaxies swirling around each other. Finally I saw something that resembled the great wall of china swaying from one side of the screen to the other and a light that seemed to be constantly swallowing the wall. at first lots of diffrent shapes randomly appearing all over the screen then i was over water between 2 wooded areas following someone come to find out i was flying but i had no idea where to but once i landed the sky changed and i could see a house that i felt like i should recognize but didnt and then i was alone and i dont remember what i saw next i must have exited the ganzflicker screen. At first mostly shapes and lines, some blue-ish static looking stuff kind of in a pattern all over the screen, almost like balls of electricity or lightning. After about a minute a silhouette of a person appeared sort of at the end of a hallway or tunnel right in the middle of the screen, for some reason I felt as though it was some sort of religious or mystical figure. It reminded me a bit of William Blake's The Ancient of Days (this was probably the most emotionally evocative moment). That lasted a few moments, maybe thirty seconds at most, then that morphed into more patterns. Flashes of text, words and sentences I couldn't quite read arranged in a checkered pattern. Then some stars or planet looking things. Something that looked kind of like a spiral galaxy. Then some oscillating beams of yellowish light shooting vertically then horizontally then diagonally across the screen. Then it appeared like I was moving down some kind of track. Like in the front seat of a rollercoaster or strapped to the front of a locomotive moving through a tunnel. Then everything just kind of devolved into a gray haze for the last minute or two. Some patterns emerged here and there and some more flashes of text, a few more oscillating and spiraling things, but nothing very distinct. Near the end it appeared that the screen began to tear at the edges, almost like an old, tattered piece of paper or papyrus. For the most part nothing was super vivid, but it was always clear what I was looking at when something distinct did emerge. The most vivid thing was the train track thing I saw, which wasn't quite lifelike, but it was close; it lasted maybe thirty seconds at most. at first simple shapes but then more.... textures, like my screen was turning into fabric and 3D objects. kind of like gears? then images became more complex, like palm trees and farms. i saw spinning blades like spurs that morphed into windmills and i saw storm clouds, like cumulonimbus and mammatus clouds, heavy with rain, and then lightning. then a tunnel.  it felt like my screen was expanding and would engulf me. at some point i saw a bomb and a mushroom cloud. it was quite anxiety inducing. i mostly saw red with black, as well as white, blue, and less frequently: orange, pink, yellow, and purple. i did not see green. At first the pattern was jarring, but as I eased into it I observed the following. The screen morphed from a simple uniform flicker to a pulsing emanating from top to bottom. this eventually morphed to be different parts were either on or off at the same time. At first the red pulsed in a circle similar to ""jumpin' jackpot"", before becoming splotches. From then on, by relaxing, the imagery was about as in depth as the after-image from a too-bright room, occasionally ""popping-out"" of the screen in the way the ""magic eye"" books work.  most of the imagery was focused around the center of my vision, things like balls and blobs, but later on morphed into a larger and larger revolving sphere of honeycomb, slowly increasing in size until the edge of the sphere became the horizon of a planet, in a sci-fi way, but again, no greater clarity than a combination after-image/magic eye. The whole experience reminded me of the closed-eye hallucinations I get when I'm very sleep deprived. I could relax into it, or snap out of it, but I never felt rewarded or punished for it. At first the screen seemed to split into red/black checkers. These then ended up rotating around the screen in different patterns and directions. At first there were different size rectangles flashing all over the screen. Next two spheres appeared in the upper right and left of the screen. Then a very large at least four story building appeared. It had towers, like the Smithsonian castle in DC, at the upper corners. In my head I heard the word Chicago. The “voice” wasn’t audible it was in my head. 
Then it returned to rectangles and squares. Occasionally in the rectangles squiggly lines appeared in the center of the rectangles. Like sound frequencies but vertical rather than horizontal and there are so many it looked like spaghetti noodles. At first they were anime like explosions and circles. Full suns with all the white and dark spots. Weird Ferris wheels and cosmic Beyblades fighting together with many colors flashing greens and blue in a black backgrounds. Cosmic Backgrounds and going through space with flashing planets appearing at center and drifting from the view. 90's anime-like fighting scenes and other things. the general color was either black or redness
I also saw a child's dark room with a silhouette of a clown in the unilluminated open door. at first with the white noise i felt cold because of the noise of the water then i things started to appear didnt know it was apart of it . i first i was scared but i relaxed because i was courise to do it all the way threw the 10 min water noise At first, driving through a city at night - at first I was looking out a window and then from a ""bumper cam"" POV. There was a bright light in the sky, so I went towards it and ended up flyignthrough space, past and through galaxies, towards a blackhole. Then I was in another city  At first, I just saw black and red screens flickering, but eventually it was like I could see blues/deep blue-greens, with occasional hints of oranges or yellows. The screen seemed to pulsate. Eventually, it was like I could see streams of circles moving around the screen. At first, these seemed to be circles falling down the screen, but eventually they seemed to transition to the screen spinning in an anti-clockwise motion around what seemed to be a central circle. I then wondered if I could consciously make the screen spin in a clockwise motion, and after thinking about it for about 5-10 seconds, I found I could switch between the two (anti-clockwise versus clockwise) easily. At some point, it then looked like the screen was following lines downward. I again tried to imagine if I could make the lines to upward, and I could. I was surprised that I could exert some sort of conscious control over what I was seeing. Eventually, my eyes just started to grow fatigued and uncomfortable. I didn't see anything else other than that described above. At first, i saw lines on the edges if the screen. These lines would slowly grow, encompassing the sides of the screen, with only one line going towards the center. From there, i saw an X mark on the screen as, then the colors started to look slightly different, and the flickering was no longer constant. The X was dark, i woild say black, but to me it just felt like a shadow-ish form of black. Very clear, but not exactly as popping out as the lines were. (The lines were red and white, if that makes sense- extremely clear and vivid). While the X was there, the flickering would be irregular- Sometimes it would pause on red for slightly longer, other times on black. There would also be discoloration on the red, where it would be brighter- something closer to pink. There would also be times, but very briefly, where the color would just disappear and it would look like a gray-black-bluish color. Im not sure if that makes sense, but it was like it was devoid of color. Then, it shifted to the shapes. At first, i would see simple rectangles, squares or diamonds. A bit later and they started rotating at extremely high speeds. Then it got to the point where the rotations themselves started to look weird. They would rotate in 2 different directions at the same time, of they would rotate unto itself. From there, i got the top view of a sort of underwater waterfall(?). The water would fall into a giant hole in the center, and the hole was extremely dark in contrast to the top of the waterfall. Then ut changed into a face. The face was very weird. At first it looked like some sort of kaleidoscope with facial features, but then it started going dark and expanding to the sides- turning into an oval. Then, it changed into a forest, but the forest didn't pop out as much as the waterfall (the waterfall felt as if i was looking at it in real life, but the forest looked artificial(?)). From there, the trees turned into towers, with weird shaped windows that looked like it was a mesh between rectangles bent in half and circles. The towers themselves werent as clear as the windows for some reason.then i blinked( i was blinking regularly during this) and the screen looked infinitely darker. The original bright red was very dark, as if it were the color of wine. Thats where i stopped because my eyes started to get sore, and i had a slight headache.The noise(i clicked the link about 5 seconds before the flickering video) stopped at 8:43. At first, I saw long streaks moving like snakes. They slithered like a snake, and they were moving in 3 dimensions (maybe like a snake or an eel swimming). I also saw long lines of spheres moving in swirling motions. Almost like a whirlpool. I tried make certain images appear by thinking about them. I made several eyes appear, but I only saw one at a time. Each eye looked a bit different than the last. I think all the images were white with a red background. At first, it was dancing lines, like pretzel sticks, bouncing and traveling. Then TIE fighters, hundreds of them in patterns. Then bursts, like my mind was superimposing images I knew into the space between flashes. I saw nebulae, galaxies, light spinning into a black hole kind of like the movie Interstellar but not exactly, way more 3d and rock chunky with the light being plasma instead of cgi unsubstantial beams. Then everything took on a quality of an old film with the scratches and hairs in front, that lasted quite a few minutes while I kept seeing images in between spaces. VanGogh, an Egyptian temple with a long walkway and walls going to its door, geometric shapes, colors that would frame the outsides in greens, purples, yellows, and black. I'd see changing shapes during the bright color flashes. When I'd blink, it would reset for a moment before continuing. It was like a slideshow almost. At first, it was just a geometric pattern, similar to chicken wire. Eventually, a capital letter “A” appeared in the center on a diagonal. At first, it was just red and black flickering, but I began to notice a small circle in the center of my vision.  On occasion, some rays of light would extend from it (between four and six) and would sometimes rotate.  Then, I saw a pentagon and, eventually, it seemed as though I was seeing some large, swirling shapes (like you'd see in simulations of galaxy movements).  At some point, I noticed that, while red was still the predominant color, I was getting some blue, green, and yellow, as well, a sort of static (as you'd see on an older television) made up of red, blue, yellow, and green, and the black had pretty much vanished.  A couple times, I saw what looked like eyes and, maybe, a human or primate face (very vague, almost indistinguishable features, though) which would open its mouth, but these lasted for a brief moment, before they would swirl in that same galaxy-movement way as most of the other shapes.  I saw a quick flash of something that may have been a city skyline, but I was actively looking for landscapes, at that time, so that may account for that. At first, kaleidoscope like shapes, flickers like before a migraine, 3D like images from those old 3D picture books. Then, animal and monster like faces, a clown face sneering and laughing, little lizards crawling, a dragon, laser shows, lightsaber battle, landscape with a summer lightning storm, surface of water with fishes swimming underneath, bugs crawling everywhere, walking down a hallway, spinning, a top spinning, faces again, and then the surface of water with fish swimming again. at first, the blast of flashing red. then after a couple of minutes, I began to see other colors, mostly blues. as the experience went on, I saw more black at upper and lower edges. I had the feeling that i didn't want to blink, that i wanted to get deeper, and then I began to see shapes, things like hashtags, something kind of rectangular with a surface like a cheese grater. I once distinctly thought i saw a big eye to my left. lots of...almost coherence, as if i was looking into a resolving landscape that mostly would not completely resolve. At first, there were black geometric shapes and blue patterns (fractal-like, like the Mandelbrot set). A few seconds later, green ""trails"" started to appear.
After some time, cyan trails appeared. At approximately the same time, my geometric shapes started getting more complex and detailed, very much like in hypnagogic hallucinations before falling asleep.
Just like with these, my shapes started turning into complex objects and orange and blue trails slowly appeared. These objects were morphing and moving, I could describe them as feathers, fabrics, silhouettes of people, wood...
Some of these followed my center of vision. And there was an orange dot in it, right at the center. At first, while closer to the screen, it seemed almost like looking through a window into a red-lit room with faint black shadows down the sides, like a scene out of a horror movie, then a small patch of diagonal black lines from top right to bottom left, then inconsistent black masses like a duo-tone water that didn't have a consistent flow up or down At first, within 30 seconds, I saw that the screen was torn in two, the image was split in two, and it was spinning. In the 2nd minute, I saw a shopping mall or anything similar to it. I saw things like shapes, empty cities, then after 7 minutes I didn't see anything until 9 minutes I saw different colors at 9 minutes I saw all the colors I didn't see anything until 11 minutes At one point I saw what looked like train passing.  Then it looked like I was on a train traveling in a tunnel.  I also saw smoke and some green colors. At one point I thought I saw a very rugged looking butterfly  At one point, space was behind the flickers; it was the only time where a non red/black color was visible, because the stars were white over a blueish grey background. Other visuals aside from the constant swirling fractals were these sort of amoeba-shaped small circles in a group that glided around the screen. A couple imagery-type visuals were two pipes (center-top right quadrant), the faint image of a sort of symmetrical foyer which covered the screen. at one stage it thought i saw eyes and a face. Most of the time it look like stick drawings or simple cartoon drawings, and i though I could make out written words but couldn't read them At some point it became a gradient of orange, red, blue and pink. I saw flares, like laser shots being fired into some kind of space. I saw flares ignite and flip, and flare. Sometimes it felt like I was flying or zooming through a tunnel at light-speed. Other times it felt like I was being whirled around a sphere, like a planet. Other times I'd see webs, they looked like fractals of flowers, they were sharper and had lines, while the flares were more loose. At some point I felt I could stick my hand through the screen because it looked like a pink-blue pool of space. Then, later on, I thought I saw a bridge, or a city in the sky, like on top of a really high mountain, and clouds were washing through it. It was pretty dim and vague, and the colors were still the same gradient I mentioned above, so it was weird, but I thought I saw something. Even a spider-like monster at first. There'd be a few times where I felt pretty joyful and exhilarated, like I was in the cinema, and there'd be times where I felt a prick of emotion that made me want to cry in a sense? But those kinds were brief. At times I felt sleepy and mesmerized, but none of the feelings lasted long. Then I'd go back to seeing flares again, and the colors were much duller. I got bored and ended it I think above ten minutes.  at some points, it felt like I was travelling through space, jumping through time like in a hyperdrive, mostly moving patterns at the beginning colors start to appear, faster and faster every time. some patterns.  then i saw a city skyline, for a few seconds, more patterns, trees for a few seconds, more patterns after, a light house that turned into a rocket shit in ignition. after a while, there was a 4 leg star pulsating in the middle of the screen, it changed into a hole where the colors would convert. for some time i saw what could be described like a sky full of stars with the colors changing in front of it. after a while the colors where changing so fast, and the pattern where changing so fast that i could see images. only patterns changing, pulsating. the color got more vivid and fast and it sounded like it was raining and thunderstorming. At the beginning I saw shapes similar to cumulus clouds that remained even after closing my eyes; Then I began to see a triangle in the center that was formed or pulse, followed by a vortex rotating to the center of the screen many times, if I concentrated a little, I could change its direction, but after that it disappeared in a short time, already in the second 10 minute set sometimes the vortex would move and I would see it horizontally as a galaxy; At the extremes, I sometimes saw spots or circles pulsing,  that were followed by an apparent growth on the screen, which was the most vivid thing I felt; Also in the second set I could see an inverted triangle in the center or both triangles, the straight and the inverted at the same time pulsing but when I closed my eyes I saw small triangles all over the place; Also when the electric saw start in the background of my neighborhood I was a little scared at first, coming to believe I saw lines with spikes on the screen, but then the sound of the saw did not seem unpleasant to me; and as an extra I saw some squares, a cross and circles from time to time feeling only once the sensation of depth with some vertical lines that I saw. At the beginning I saw some kind of sharp pointed shapes that went from the middle towards all corners At the start I saw buildings resembling pyramids and large towers, mid experience i focused more on the screen and saw it almost come out of my computer and tilt and coming closer to my eyes, after the 10 minutes I looked up and could see patterns of my roof. at the start numerous narrow straight but short (1/2--3/4in)crossing lines at all angles,  then short lived cloud like shapes like an animated version of something boiling but with more angular edges, variations in speed if I moved my head, a lighter border around the main display (could be an affect of the monitor backlight) At the start there were grid like patterns, a couple mins more and a rainbow structure (stripes) appeared. The rainbow structure flipped sides and doubled as time went on, when it doubled it usually bent around a blueish purple bullseye. Main colors on rainbow (excluding the red and black flashing) was a mix of yellow, green, and blue. Occasionally the rainbow would shift to a hyperbolic type pattern with similar colors and then fade back to flashing.
Towards midpoint my vision split and became unfocused this happened until the end. The edges of the screen swayed and shifted throughout the experience. Near end my vison started to flicker in sync with the pulse.
Spider web type networks appeared occasionally, but only showed up for a few moments before fading At time it was like a spiderweb at times with different pixels of color (e.g. white and blue) at places where lines of the web would intersect. Towards the end (last 4 minutes) it was like i was looking into another space. Often times patterns would move around the screen and morph. I also experienced the screen as being split in half in the middle, like watching a canyon or a crack in the ground from above (approx. 3 centimeters wide), except the lines of the folds were perfectly straight. Sometimes it was like circles with other smaller circles orbiting them in close proximity were moving around the screen. I saw a lot of blue and white in addition to red and black. at times it reminded me of hot lava or dying coal embers. I also saw circles. At times it was like think lines moving up or down the screen, almost gave a feeling of riding an elevator really fast down or looking at a static TV that has those lines moving Thick and small. I saw triangles/pyramids start to come up from the bottom of the screen. Other times it was like a spiral galaxy or cyclone vortex that would form wherever my focal point was. It would start out as a geometric spider web type wheel and then as it spun faster it felt like it morphed into a 3 dimensional vortex that was pulling me in. As I got pulled in it felt like I shot at warp speed forward ahead, giving me a feeling of flying through space at light speed. Then usually after I would blink I kept seeing either a cross, X or what seemed like a stick figure with two arms to the side of the head and long legs. Sometimes it felt like I was in a big wave that would crash and it looked like violent rapid water flow swashing around. I saw electric blue and purple twinkle charges all around at times that would start moving around and once I focused on one spot the vortex spin would happen again."

Other times I saw a bluish gray color.  A black circle was in the center at times.  At times the screen seemed to move.  There appeared to be movement at times, always from left to right.  I spidery lightening, a cowboy, a graviton carnival ride, a zoetrope. River water rushing over a series of rocks to make small rapids. A native American on horseback. I saw pink and yellow at the top of the screen near the end. At times, simple shapes, also stars moving in complex patterns, saw bricks form a tunnel, they then flipped to the inside of a tower looking up. Pyramid with a light in beams coming from the top.  Attempt 1:
Black/White flicker → I noticed my screen was dirty → Cleaned it up for a bit

Attempt 2: Tried doing it without anything in mind
Black/White flicker → Saw something like -|-, silhouette of dark eyes with something dividing in the middle, reminds me of an owl → Then it transformed to radial shape, sometimes cross, asterisk shape (*), or six-sided asterisk → The entire shape started to rotate

Attempt 3: Tried to visualize something
Saw silhouette of Jumpy Dumpty (Klee, Genshin Impact)
Saw silhouette of back of Archer (Fate Stay/Night)
Saw silhouette of Face of Generic Red-Skinned Demon
→ Red-themed characters/icons

Also, sometimes, I perceive the flickers to have variable speeds, or the flicker is not at the same time for the entire screen. Backrooms, siren man and similar creatures my family Ball of fibres. Sparkles. Zooming in and out. Weird morphed animals ball of light ball of light all around, lines/patterns not in center of vision  Ball of light, lion getting speared, lion attacking hunter? Saturns rings, tornado, womens face Balls in parallel straight lines, fractal patterns balls of light in the center, followed by swirling, alternating between the two Balls of light, blue & green flashes Balls of moving lightmostly. The most vivid image was a tunnel, kind of like a train tunnel. It wasn't to the point where reality lines blurred but it certainly brought the idea of a train tunnel into my head. Balls of pulsing light growing and moving off screen, arrows forming patterns and lines sometimes drawing shapes that turned into like a skeletal hand. reset when I closed my eyes a bit. Balls of spinning light in patterns with gold glitter in between them. Sometimes it turned blue, reversed directions etc Based on the red background, geometric patterns were constantly moving up, down, left, and right. Based on the red background, geometric patterns were constantly moving up, down, left, and right. Basically my everyday visual disturbances from overindulgence in hallucinogens, amplified. It's like a trigger for closed eye visuals coming back out into open eye territory. Basically patterns of red and black, sometimes moving or swirling. bats, crystals, moving waves, lightning, angry people Battle ships, space ships Beams from the edges Beams of white light then orange colors after the orange went to black I started seeing figures of peoples outlines of what seemed like sexual activity but the seen would change to another one before I could distinguish them. Beams that looked like an arrow across a path. Paths formed were simple and sometimes had a kaleidoscope effect where multiple beams formed a pattern. Bee's faces in red and black. Then mostly fractal noise, shapes, swirls, whorls etc. Towards the end the red and Blue (not back) started to pulse and then the whole scene emerged from the screen and became 3D in front of the screen. Every so often I could see rough outlines of buildings (e.g. spires of cathedrals etc) in the noise. Began to see fractals right away. Then began to se blue in the flicker.  Afterwards a slight spiral from the outside going to the middle wit a left turn began to emerge. Then I started to feel like I was spinning.  Shapes of fluffy? thing began to pop up (like a tree canopy), then I began to move like I was flying over a dense forest.  These were still in the red and blue flicker with a slight blue dominance.  Then I ""spotted"" a fast moving river and followed it, flying down and over the waterfall.  My stomach, whole body felt like I was on a roller coaster.  I continued to have this flying feeling and began to turn in different directions as the patterns changed.  Blinking mildly reset the directionality of movement. It was wild and wonderful.  I feel like I took one of those wing suit flights off a cliff.  Began with a cross-like image in the aspect ratio of the viewing screen, then the visual frequency doubled, then doubled again, then appeared chequer-board like, then spherical.  I noticed red coloured fringed white while black colours fringed blue.  Went through several distinct phases of visual complexity and apparently colour, with a noticeable period of grey-blue-green colouration about 8 minute in.  Appeared to see trees or water visuals, as well as pond ripples, swirls, radial patterns, grid patterns and such.  The visuals then took on a clearly 3D tone and I had a sense of an pair of expanding planes forming a top and bottom of the world stretching if into infinity with amorphous shapes moving and shifting within the visual field.   I noticed I could use my minds eye to evoke representative structure in my perception of the in the visual noise, such as objects, though it was very jagged and fuzzy like a badly-tuned analog TV image. behind' the flashing pattern, there was a starfield, rotating counterclockwise.  I was able to correct the spin and stabilize, then rotate the view to the right.  There were two roughly spherical objects, one further away in the upper left, one closer in the lower right.  There were waving yellow tendrils coming out of both objects and one tendril persistently  connected the two objects.  The upper left object had greyer coloration with hard angles and protrusions on it, the lower right was more of a tan/yellow color and fairly smooth.  I closed one eye at a time, and the starfield started spinning again, but the stars were only visible from my left eye.  The spheres and tendrils were only visible in my right eye, which could not see the starfield imagery or the 'spin'; the spheres positions were static relative to the starfield whether it was spinning or not. Best could described as jagged bolts of lightning shooting all over the screen. Also saw a navy blue flicker between the red and black, and after a while three or four blue orbs began to float near the periphery and center of the screen for quite some time. Beyond the flicker was a complex ink drawing on white paper.  I imagined it as a cartoonist's sketch for a 'Looney Tunes' cell of Bugs Bunny in  a  very detailed work shop.  I kept wanting to see more of it filled out and all in one, but the large patches of the room were very detailed. Liked it Big face, horse, brontosaurus, hippo eating a grass, person riding a elephant Billowy with lines. Reminded me of close-ups of the Suns surface and the fibers in fiberboard. Bisecting horizontal and vertical light bars that moved left to right across the screen changing in direction then morphing into other 3-D shapes with texture, cloud like mound forms, fire across the bottom of the screen, landscapes of large grassy fields surrounded by rocks, long gravel or dirt pathways edged with stones, concrete and brick angular structures that initially looked like the first several stories of an old castle that had never been completely built or that had suffered damage such that upper floors or roof structures were missing. These ancient-looking structures morphed into what looked more like a midcentury-modern school (one story glass and brick box-like structure in the center of the screen); waves like tidal waves moving right to left across the screen, flashes of words in bold capital print like headlines mixed with overlapping times news print pages with paragraphs with words right side up and upside down. The words generally were not readable as they overlapped other paragraphs and images, though occasionally a word stood out (eg. “Watch”, familiar names) in my left lower field of vision that moved left to right to the center then disappeared. Vague formations that looked like monster faces or fantastical or cartoonish heads that were large and blob-like in my center right field of vision. These were static images that lasted a few seconds. Always swirling gyroscope spirals of red, black and toward the end purple fractals and strands. Black and red flashes , lines , varying speeds Black and red forming different colours and shapes, twirling and warping, circular movements, constant sense of falling / depth. Black cubes one at a time popped up a few times.  Small size, black, not rotating but could tell they were 3d cubes.  Went back to nothing on the screen but flashing red for next 4 min.  Stopped watching. Black door, explosions, ball, faint lines of images but unrecognizable  Black grids and square going from sides to center and merging
Borders of the screen switching to the yellow
Some subliminal like image hard to describe appearing frenquently between the 7-8 minutes black lines, rotating screen, going around at great speed.  Sometimes the rotating object was above and then it changed to the left of the screen, then to the right, always going around. Black part shifted between blue, violet/purple, and green. 
Clouds and amorphous shapes started to develop early on (similar to when I close my eyes for any length of time)
Mountain-like shapes developed later and were ephemeral 
Kaleidoscopic sensation (similar to staring at a perfectly clear afternoon sky) came and went
Red never did anything different Black rectangle almost size of screen, fade to gray, to black, moving all around, then circle in the middle at times, and flashes of blue white and orange mingled together along edges Black red shapes black shapes and horizontal figures Black vertical lines, which appear with every color transition between red and black Blobs - shapes-  blobs of dark circles on light background, grey hexagon outlines on black/red, other grey geometric patterns on black/red. Block colours changing from one to another. they would slow down and last a second and flick to another colour, mainly red, blue, purple, pink. The screen would be fully blue, turned off and made purple. A ball that moved in a spiral pattern into the center of the screen would flicker extremly fast decressing its circle size then start again from outer edge. this happened with the block colours in background. Once the ball hit the center it threw 4 balls out to the outer edge to start the spiral again. from time to time it looked like the screen was expanding or more black would fill in from top to bottom. My eyes were continuously pulled to the top left of the screen and snapped back when the ball would hit the center. blocs Blops of color red and dark  in different pattern alternating , amd make me sleepy  blotches of color shimmering, at times the black was perceived as blue, sometimes the blotches formed into latticework or the image seemed to scroll repetitively like an old TV set  Blue and green lines, some straight, some curved. Blue and orangey-yellow semi-circles morphing into fine downy feathers then into birds who laboured to fly diagonally, blue waterfalls (merged with the sound of the waterfall) falling at an angle vertically and bulging out of the screen, rockets of various fireworks flying diagonally, camera flashing (the old type) with the sound of water becoming the sound of rolling camera, the camera wheels moving on the gravel etc. blue and red flashes, screens of all blue and all red, the moon in all blue, the sun in all red spitting little balls of fire. constant swirls, sometimes merging into a big swirl. a slippery dip / slide as well.  Blue and yellow lightning bolts zigzagging across the screen, a faint green fairground swing spinning rapidly, faint green boxes hovering around the screen more slowly Blue balls of light flickering in the beginning blue dots, similar to what you see when you close your eyes. Blue field of constant shifting complex geometric shapes blue hexagon pattern with dark outlines Blue lines, two of them most of the time, they were usually in a cross across the whole screen and they were laid upon one other. The bottom one often started rotating and the whole space inside the screen rotated with it, while the upper one stayed stationary.

Many times the blue lines were in different places or did not move at all. I also saw a ball of red light which went wherever I wanted it to go. Usually these visions seemed very real as if my eye is just tired, but when I saw i could control it, I recognized it is some kind of hallucination. blue swirling wheel Blue swirls controlled by blinking Blue, green orange yellow, swirling sometimes Blue, once in a while a line here or there.  Blue, yellow and orange mottled and strong colors Blue, yellow, orange and red lines alternating vertically, horizontally, diagonal and wavy. The screen got narrowed frequently as if it was a door closing. blue/black cityscape surrounding the edges of changing balls/grids of red/yellow/orange patterns --also  brown/green/yellow patches of farmland covering the center of the screen from above like looking down from a plane Blues and greens. Faint sort of spinning galactic feature in the center, replaced later by an X. blues screen, felt like I was driving down a road with lots of overhaning branches that blocked out the light periodically Blues, greens and oranges appeared after a few seconds of staring. Transitions between square patterns, spider web like arrays, and eventually spinning wheels seen from between directly above (circles) to from the side, giving the appearance of ellipses. Blues, greens, geometric linework bluish patterns Blurred/discoloured screen edges, red ""lightning/laser"" lines, swirls Bodies, shapes, stars, mountains, spoons, balloon animals Body shapes, tree, an eagle. Exploding geometric shapes bouncing circles, many of them following each other, Stripes of ?light? going from a point in top left of the screen, very fast line of laser going from top left to down right side of the screen, ""flower"" of circles that was rotating left or right with it's center standing still i saw two of them on screen at the same time Box-like repeating rectangular patterns, expanding out from a bright light in the centre of the screen.  Mostly shades of orange alternating with electric blue or deep blue, plus yellows and white and to a lesser extent other colours like green.  Often created a tunnel effect (a lot like the Dr Who intro), but sometimes shapes oscillating back and forth across the screen.  Also fainer frill-light patterns, green and black, outside the screen.  branching lines like lightning with different colored outlines starting from a big x in centre screen, green circle/oval in centre, green forest viewed from above  brian like or spaghetti type lines and shapes Bricks Bricks at first like a chessboard, with nice rounded corners, same side-ratio as the screen and 10-15 to a row, then they started to tunnel-funnel like going to warp-speed in starwars, then the dark black blinks turned green and blue-ish colors, then the funnel-tunnel started spiralling and after ½ minute I felt nauseous and seasick from all the movements and stopped after approx 6 minutes in total. brief landscapes and clouds Bright red lines that rotated slowly, sometimes slowing down and reversing direction. Brought up images in my mind more so then what I saw in the screen bubbles of varying colors and sizes exploding all over the screen Building, dog, cat, face Buildings and faces Buildings and fractals  Buildings cats old people Buildings of gold that appeared to melt and morph into butterflies Buildings, rivers, greenery bulls eyes, cross in a bullseye pattern, random lines and bright spots, balls of color randomly dispersed  Bursts of light, strange shapes, bright colors and a perception of  the computer screen getting bigger and smaller Butterfly  butterfly and boat camp fire close up can’t explain in words Cannot fully explain due to random nature Canyon mountainside up to the sky cartoonish faces and bodies, one fairly realistic face similar to the mask of tragedy, simple line drawing of a stonehenge like formation rotating quickly, many geometric shapes and patterns often moving in a particular direction, going back and forth or rotating, bubbles or circles or balloons cathedral ceilings. geometric shapes, circles of people lying on the ground. bright lights being shone on the ground from afar. projectiles from space like meteors hitting the ground, looking at a planet from another point in space"

In the periphery I would occasionally see more persistent small, fuzzy dark blobs which would move around like eye floaters (they might have been eye floaters, but I don't think so). change of color, horizontal lines that would come and go; circles on the hand, floating circles; the hand moved, the hand appeared all over the screen but in a different color and was constantly moving Changes in color to purples, brief faces, spiderwebs Changing colors and patterns  Changing colors, changing shapes, would try to look at something and would change again  changing colors, clouds of shapes, more greens and blues added to the black and red Changing patterns, shapes Changing shapes of different colors (although mostly lots of versions of green) flickering all over the screen. checkboard pattern Checker board pattern and illuminated line like a lightning bolt on checker board diagonals Checkerboard  Checkerboard pattern with other patterns ""sliding"" around on top. Certain abstract shapes, a vision of a shark swimming directly overhead. Checkerboard, star field, sometime a ""rolling circle"" that I could make roll clockwise or anti-clockwise with my mind. Chequered shapes, bands of darker stripes that I could control with my mind, mottled patterns, fuzzy radiating circles. Plenty of green and white. Different sides seemed to flash at different rates, though would periodically sync up. After a while the alternately flashing sides would move around the centre. Chessboard like patterns, swirling into the corners, yellows and whites (as well as red) christian cross christian cross cinsel organlar lunapark  Circle  Circle in the center with ""rays"" extending from the circle. similar to Japanese Rising Sun Flag Circle of bluish white balls(stars?) Circle with branches inside, some black that grew and shrunk Circle with radiating color, meandering around the screen Circles interchanging with lines. The lines were similar to ""beams of energy"", typical for sci-fi movies. They were usually 5 arms going in directions of the arms of a star, but sometimes the top arm split into two and ""pushed"" the other ones to create a symmetrical formation all focusing on the exact point I was looking at, in the center of that point. Circles of red black and various shades of grey Circles oscillating in between random lines of squares and diamonds. Circles rotating around each other. Then the mothman which floated up and out of the screen. Then several circles in a line jiggling up and down. Circles spreading out and shrinking into the middle and near the middle, rectangle through the screen,  Circles with radiating webs, blue colors Circles, balls, in a grid like pattern Circles, lines, triangles, green, yellow and blue Circles, the number 4, the letters t, x and z, squares, ovals, tunnels, portals, triangles Circles.

In the Way I saw ...in this Way I did see  some form like a wheel moving  More ciclic movements Circular red and gray pattern like a kaleidoscope Circus type structures and horrifying multicolored flashing bald clown acrobats morphing and twisting about. Extraordinary depth, like I was sucked into the tunnel ride on Willy Wonka city streets with people lining the streets, train tracks, tunnel, falling from the top of tall buildings, geometric shapes, space and stars  Cityscapes and faces Clear green dots at places. At some point a black horizon with black shapes above and beyond - like castles reflecting in a lake - Clearer red cross and X shape centered in my field of vision (alternating). Appeared as after-images between flickers. Could either see the cross or the X. Started seeing the X after about a minute then when concentrating, I could switch to the cross and vice versa, as if concentrating on the vision of an eye or the other. Also, the background color between flickers started to appear blue or purple. Nothing more vivid than that. Clearly defined rainbow stripes forming asymmetric shapes, white dots moving outwards from centre, screen seeming to expand, depth in the screen that I was rushing into, indistinct dark blue shapes, indistinct monochrome horse and rider moving across screen before fading and a new one appearing in centre Clockwise and counterclockwise spinning. Then diagonal pulses. A stationary square in the center while spinning. A tunnel effect. And then a starfield as if turning right. Then straight. then turning left. But mostly appearing to turn right but alternating. Like an old screensaver but just specs. No warp effect.  The starfield was initially all white specs. then became white, red, and green. The red flickers would still have different patterns mentioned. The starfield was always behind that. I tried not to project any thoughts onto the image. I didn't see anything like a castle or road.  Clouds making shapes of things Clusters of flashing lights, otherwise, nothing notable nor identifiable clusters of grids on a background evocative of the flames of a bonfire color started as red/black but morphed to blue and red/pink. Geometric shapes with sharp angles appeared as well as swirls. Constantly moving. With eyes shut I saw different geometric shapes in shades of gray. Colored geometric shape around edge of ipad Colored lines that rotated colored mosaic colores azules además de rojo y negro Colorful dots and some images are skiing colorful geometric patterns like abstract paintings, a moving flamelike or firework-like light, flames, white star constellations, dark lines Colors Colors alternated flickering with red (yellow, pink, green), some swirling line patterns, patches of white light, some shapes starting starting from the middle of the screen. Visual patterns were subtle shifts from one to the next and back to red. Color changes were more frequent in the first half. Colors and pulsating lights  colors like yellow began appearing in places Colors shifting to cyan/yellow and magenta around border of screen. Center-of-sight vertical line, but with cellular-like indistinct shapes throughout. Image appeared to flicker with these cellular-like shapes in a different speed. colors that didn't seem possible, for example both yellow and black simultaneously but also separately somehow. bright neon electric white lines popping in and out. shapes and color splotches that would morph and move, while others stayed still. a red/white dot in the middle of the screen, blinking occasionally and disappearing colors were changing constantly...reds, pinks, yellow, green sometimes. I also saw what looked like I a pattern...outlines of spots like on a leopard. just the outline of that pattern. eventually that image went away. the various colors were constant. colors yellow blue and green, patterns that tunneled and rolled across the screen Colour flicker changed from black to blue Colour mainly a green sort of blue with red patches.  Beneath the colour were abstract patterns like fine line drawings - these were rounded and not sharp in any way.  Now and then there were starburst patterns of yellow with white centres.  If I looked at the periphery of the screen, there were jagged patterns at he borders of red and black.  These latter two images were much sharper in nature.   Colours and balls of light; hyperspace; tunnels; more without noise Colours green, blue and yellow come in and out at various times. After a less than a minute (I think) saw multiple fine [white] lined structures, each consisting of 3 equal lines joined at a point. They were stably positioned but NOT in a rigid e.g. grid structure. Saw rotation and swirling effects toward the monitor centre. Saw rotating, canted, cylinder effect but not very distinct/well defined. Saw a kind of 'simmering porridge' effect (sorry, that's the best description I can come up with) Comic book illustration flipping through the pages extremely fast  Complete clear spheres, with maybe more spheres inside, all spinning in own axis but also spinning in a spiral, colors changed from red to blue to green to almost yellow Complex geometry, fractals, swirling, moving with their own internal logic, lots of sucking in and exploding to a point like a black hole, rings of circles, cubes, starfields, tunnels, I kept seeing a black shadowy notification bar emerge from the top that felt like my expectation to be interrupted by technology. Complex geometry, sine waves, faces Complex: Mostly eyes closed and open, tree scapes, dragons and snakes mouths, all of witch were distorted (some more some just a bit), at some point i also saw water coming out of the screen (although it looked a bit ""artificial'); Mostly i saw shapes and patterns intertwining  concentric circles Concentric circles spiraling in opposite directions; visual effect of going through a tunnel; fractal-like patterns; triangles and circles; navy blue and green began to show up after a few minutes concentric circles, color gradients (other than red or black) concentric circles, made me want to close my eyes and go to sleep Concentric patterns from the center of my vision, moving past me on all sides like I was travelling through a tunnel. Also some other colors, notably yellow and a faint blue Connecting geometric patterns and 3d shapes connected at nodes. Consistent images & light with shapes & images  constant color changes and shapes that were blurred, not distinct, all blending.  Constant morphing into different shapes, such as rotating like a fan, once was a star-like shape that ""radiated"" outward and got bigger.  Sometimes almost a chopping motion in the center of a darker color and then radiations from that to its left and right.  Sometimes it looked like it was flickering as red and dark blue instead of red and black.  Constant movement towards a city skyline, or maybe a mountain range. Saw some kind of faces at first, then humanoid shapes Constantly a black door half open people images but always as shadows my own face a DNA helix bubbles covering entire screen diamond shapes covering the entire screen a black box center screen Constantly moving, dynamic shapes similarly to what I experience before a migraine (so called aura). They can be compared to a crescentic fat residue, e.g. made with a finger on a white background, low resolution mobile phone while wiggling the mobile phone forth and back (like moiré artifacts) or like the boundaries of a mandelbrot set, but unsharp, in constant fluctuation. In contrast to the aura I experience before migraines, the experience patterns are faint and scaled quite large and always in the same position (center). Furthermore, the shapes vary from circular patterns to something comparable to 2d vibration modes (depicted as bright and dark areas if the following images would be seen from above: http://www.bio-physics.at/wiki/images/Vibrations.png) Constantly shifting lines, sinusoids, and sphericals. Entire image started spinning and caused some nauseated feeling once. Seemed to have some limited changes from intentional thought. Everything was constantly moving Crisscrossed webbing moving out from the screen like multiple ripples in a pond crisscrossing shapes, lines that appeared to be moving, ect. At one point saw a bunch of tiny stars. Cross Cross hatches, spider web, fluid material  Cross hatching , alternating green and red and  black Cross shapes in the center of the screen, spikes at the edges, and occasionally blue/green spheres near the center or edges of the screen Cross, snowflake designs  crosses and moving shapes across the screen, moving spirals, mandalas, vortexes, like endermen from mincraft with swords coming at me and skeletons, weird cube worlds like a sierpinski triangle. space cities made of regular blocks. clearly my mind was able to transfer stuff over from minecraft which i had played for several hours today.  Crosses in white + water wave like conzentric patterns Crosses, grids, the outline of a person shoulders up, ovals, etc Cross-shape burst with offset X-burst morphing alternating, flows of chevron-shaped pulses across the screen, pulsating triangles giving impression of pyramids or mountains. crowds of indistinguishable black voidlike humanoids walking, a creepy face with too many teeth and stretched eyes staring at me, a clawed hand grasping at me, rain drops and squiggles merging to form shapes crumpled brpwn paper bags, broken glass patterns
 crystalline forms crystalline patterns mostly, several flashes of looking at a log jam in a river, simple shapes (a heart shape for example).  Crystals"

Dark blotches, round spots, moving vertical lines that tracked to the right dark green and blue wreath-shapes, floral-type curves like petals, outline of many small squares, a few times the screen appeared like a 3D rotating cylinder Dark zone with red floating balls within; sometimes dark zone would be greener or bluer than black; often lines of dark out red radiating out from the center of my focus; a fuzzy mode would sometimes occur where the field was unfocused, fuzzy, and pleasant, which seemed too be slightly controllable  Darker color build up over time, similar to CRT raster burn.

Different colors.

All of the descriptions above were relevant. The only other vivid colors I saw were yellow and orange. The screen kept feeling like it was growing and sometimes it felt like I was enveloped by the red and black world.

When I was more relaxed and focused, I first saw insects and other animals emerge. Then images of buildings like skyscrapers and a lighthouse, bridges, and rooms. I never experienced them as fully separate from the red and black. They had non-red colors but I don't recall whether they were as vivid as the red. Many times I had the sensation of zooming through the imagery; such as between the buildings, under the bridges, or up the lighthouse and into a duct in a room.

After a while, I stopped seeing vivid imagery, perhaps from the stress of sitting 15 minutes watching a screen flicker. Instead of giving up on trying to see god or whatever, I decided to modify the code. I changed the flicker from 66.67ms to 50ms, and the patterns, color, and imagery became much more vivid. I didn't want to break my sensory cortex, so I stopped after a few minutes.

BTW: The ""set"" variable in your Timer loop is unnecessary. Just change the second if statement into an else statement :) Distinct buildings and clouds.   Vivid pinks, purple,
Green,  aqua colors.   distorted checkerboard-like pattern with rainbow  / holographic elements, almost like looking at bent glass with polarized eyewear dogbone shapes made from shaded blue squares - pulsating like a strobe light Dogs Door, wall,stairway Doorways series, circles amid other ovals and circles Dot patterns, letters, symbols, words, equations, landscapes, shooting lines across the screen. Colors, red, black, green, orange, white. Edges were sometimes a different color than the center. All objects were white. dots all over the screen (blue-green), kind of white noise under the red, a pattern like a fabrik,  falling color if I move eyes left to right Dots in rows and column Dots of other colors lines of fainter and brighter mostly in motion if anything almost things I remember, like one thing reminded me of ascending up a sky scraper with a drone the flat edges the motion of upwards the corner of the square rectangle ""building?"" also it could have been like a track and going off the edge but staying cruising. circles and lines that would almost be like a doodled realism face . water drops like streeking down the windowpane and sometimes the water would have wiggles sideways like the heartbeat monter or the stock market average line symatry in it so every streek had the same ish sideways wiggle back to the line etc. so weird shapes that the best i can descirbe are like extra dimenional like a square triangle thing with other squares and triangles and its like that thing that has those steel balls and the magnet sticks and the shapes building the shape were changing growing shrinking going away and comming from nowhere it was amazing. Whizzing lights like i was in a tunnel and driving the the light form away comes and goes out of view but many. splashes some lingered most had some type of constant mostion of their position and most had no mostion on the action no motion on the action of apperaing or going just that they are there and now gone some linging for moments som,e ppoint it was like the brightness changed it was like diffrent but i couldnt see when the diffrence happened it just became apparent it was brighter more washed out whited out but not like serious white out just a whiter shading.lost of motion of things I didnt know what were releavtive to the other things i didnt see it as a bulding and i didnt see a face i saw what in the brighter and darker and other things that it could best be described as to be similar to. I didnt see anything like it was real outside of when I closed my eyes and the tunnel wisps got intnese that was like real things closest to real but not like i felt like i could touch it i new it was something ""extra"" ,  looked like the edges of the screen getitng blurry or hazy or seeing shapes extend past the screen and edges like wires or vines or like thorns or vains something growing and keeping its shape but becomming brighter more pronounced like the screen was a orginizsm and it was comming out, momnents of my hand around and infront of the screen it had things comming thru it almost like the radiances the objects like my hand was the background to what the screen was producing so things going over my hand not thru it but like my hand was a background to the objects on the screen even tho in reality the screen was the background. that freaked me out a tad bit. didnt it want it to stop would do more but wanted to record this. felt like time was short like it was just a few minutes like 2-3-4 not like 10-11 the white noise video stopped and i kept on it for a bit but when i checked the video it was 10 min and i didnt believe it for a moment. some times of motion even without objects i could see motion happening. sometimes a haze would grow and shirnk and hold sometimes or be still ish as it grew and went and making diffrent parts diffrent shades like it was having a influence Dots, discoloration, shave changes, stripes, patterns Dots, lines  dots, squares, crosses Double rainbows all the way across the sky, interspersed with lasers During the first five minute stretch, I saw an initial ball of light turn into diagonal crossing bars of yellow with maybe a little blue. ""behind"" these bars were complex and nearly random looking black-and-white patterns. 

During the second, 10 minute session, it began the same way but the bars of light were more vivid and with many colors, and appearing at every angle, and then constantly rotating and crossing over each-other and reforming and dissolving. Around half way through I began to see what seemed like eyes, but then the bars became more intense and overshadowed that effect.

Most interestingly, from around six minutes in until the end, I gained clear conscious control over the angle of the bars: I would ""will"" there to be a bar of a certain slope, or two crossing bars in a particular orientation, and they would appear as such, before dissolving or rotating unpredictably. I spent that whole time testing this ""ability"", and was able to make the bars quickly and easily, but more complex shapes never happened as a result of my volition, besides one circle. Dynamic 2D patterns morphing into 3D patterns. Coherent motion of surfaces in depth. Non-rigid dynamic fractal patterns, like fire or smoke. Only abstract geometric patterns, no faces, animals, scenes, etc. Visual effects were localized to the display screen, not affecting the wider visual field. Looking at the screen was somewhat uncomfortable, so I tried closing my eyes, which reduced the vividness of the effects, although they were still present. Earliest images I saw were the lines and spiderwebs. Their colors were inverting at roughly the same pace as the flicker. I usually saw red, orange and yellow but occasionally it would turn blue-ish. These shapes remind of a time I had a bad trip on marijuana. 

The screen seemed to expand from the pixels to the bevels of the monitor (~0.5 inches). It took roughly 4 seconds to complete, slowing down near the end. This happened every time I blinked. 

Then I saw grids. The grid was slowly rotating clockwise. Eventually it turned into several circles which rotated the same direction but faster. This is around where the significant color imagery occurred. The whole screen seemed to go through the most of the color wheel aside from the lighter, less vibrant and darker colors (e.g. light blue, purple, but not blue). 

I would cycle through all the above, and I noticed the rotating balls would go faster if I focused on four mid-corners of the screen (not too close to the screen corners). 

I eventually saw an eye for a couple seconds but it was nothing too detailed. ebbs and flows of spirals to concentric circles to melting. It would always return to a simple image with concentric crystal like squares on the four corners. Either flying through a tunnel or across a plain with a 360 degree camera that tracked the path I was on, like going forward then swiveling to see where I'd been. ekran eğildi ekran I şekline giriyor ve düzenliyor  Ekranım dalga dalga oluyor gibiydi ellips engineering objects, specs of light, rotating circles Ess Even right now I can close my eyes after trying the experiment and still see the ""waves."" It was not  uncomfortable at all and quite relaxing! Even though I couldn't see very clearly, I saw that I was floating in the tunnel. Every shape came into a vague black hazy flashing image of itself such as the glasses I imagined which appeared black hazy and vanishing in and out. The black and red merged into dark brackish blue at one point. Every time I blinked a different colour came back (very briefly). Usually they were most vivid in a half frame around the edge of the screen, eg. along the top and down the right side, or along the bottom and up the left side. Most of the time the central area of the screen looked like blurry, boiling lava in orange and yellow. Other colours I saw in the 'frame' were purple and lime green. At one point I saw a bright, pale yellow (almost white) pinprick in the centre of the screen which grew slightly and then disappeared. Every time the flashing appeared to slow down the images changed. Cubes scattered and stacked, inverted pyramids folding in on themselves, spinning background like I was sitting on a merry go round surrounded by posts, what appeared to be a skeletal jaw with diamond shaped teeth that was chomping, a rose with a ""censor block"" through it and many more things. Everything and nothing Everything was blurry, but I saw important parts of the information I read before while watching the video. When I slowed down the video in disbelief, I saw that they weren't actually there Exactly the kind of imagery Inexperience when I close my eyes and concentrate on what I’m seeing. Patterns and colors, fractals etc until a specific image comes into view. The image can be a single object or a landscape, surreal or concrete. The image disappears when I break focus and the process begins again unless I stop concentrating. Except the screen warping, sometimes, a small portion of the screen were as if it hasn't changed at all. It was like a part of screen was dead. Also I felt my eyes just got tired :)) expanding and contracting spirals rotating on an axis... bunches of web like constructs... geometric patterns... all kinds of colors on the vertices experienced an increasing sense of visceral anxiety which was initially minor and tolerable but became incrasingly intense until I felt nauseous and dizzy and brain-tired -- 5 minutes later still feeling a bit queasy Experiences blue instead of black, saw stars after a while, had a sensation of rapid movement in the z-axis towads me exploding balls of light, atomic bombs, time-lapse flowers budding, then blooming, then fading away, a car chase, concentric circles, scalloped patterns falling into one another, fireworks, the warm back of an eyelid, innumerable patterns, colors and gradients eye Eyes some different colors faces names body parts numbers some geometry  Eyes, face, patterns, veins  Eyes, masks, wheel of colors Eyes, road,sun, hands, broken glass, way of stones Eyes... psychedelic shapes.  Triangles up and down meeting in the middle like an auric field or an hourglass.  Eye in the middle of an upright 🔺️ ... numbers, if I focused my third eye, rainbow colors vibrating, I just stopped because I realized I could manipulate what I am seeing... but it is very good practice for third eye practice.

Faint circles or bubbles that began to merge together.  If I relaxed my eyes, it looked like the image was rotating, as if I were falling down into a spiraling red tunnel.  I would periodically close my eyes, because the blinking was giving me some mild headaches, but when I opened my eyes, whatever illusion I'd seen before had ended - but a new illusion would replace it.  At one point, it looked like a bright light was shining from the corner of the screen and pulsing into the center of the screen.  I wondered if this is what it felt like to travel on the surface of the sun.  I knew that it's all a simple optical trick, so I wondered if I could control what kinds of images I saw by thinking about specific things and then trying to find them in the flickering, but it didn't work very well.  I could, however, move the center of the spirals around the screen by willing it, and at times, it appeared as if there were two separate vortexes dancing around each other.  Maybe appeared as if there was some yellow mixed in with the red, but it was faint.  At one point, it almost looked like there were fractures or sharp webs of black, almost like fractals that were tearing themselves across the fields of red.   faint geometric Faint geometric grid of blobs, sometimes in a rotating ring. Mainly the screen appeared red but  the blobs appeared blue or yellow. All very insubstantial, however, like a sort of mottling over the screen - never anything vivid. Faint shapes made in on the screen Faint shapes made in on the screen Faint, abstract, largely symmetrical ""snowflake"" shapes. Marginally less faint, largely symmetrical patterns of horizontal and vertical bar-shaped blobs. Occasionally a ""vignette"" effect where the border of my screen was black and faded into the flashing red and black center. The red color occasionally turned yellower, but not quite orange. My eyes got sore quickly. Falling through wormholes, patters that fit the noise, funnel clouds over the ocean, volcano erupting, swamp with the trees with big roots, a ship, cannons firing, sugar cubes falling, large snowflakes, many snowflakes falling, rainbows(pink,yellow,orange,red,dark greenish blue) Most images were red, reddish orange and a varying dark greenish blue. Fans, a rainbow colored string fans, building in paris, two men walking fast black  blured disformed blots with movements. The movement changed when I moved where my eye focused. At the beginning there was a lot of blured blots but it was decreasing with time. At the end the red on the screen was much more vivid than the beginning. Fast moving letters and shapes, icons, etc Fast Tunnel-Fly-Throughs through tunnels made out of grids; Mandalas morphing into one another feeling of traveling in a circular canal Felt like I was falling down a tube or falling from a tall building from a future-esk environment. Had flickers of brutalistic buildings which contributed to dreamlike images of being in the Eastern bloc. few different patterns in rotation, with intense panning & zooming between them while it switches Field patterns intersecting. Forming a sort of fluid surface or movement through a particle accelerator animation at the same time. Patterns intersected as fields and produced new geometry. Started to fade into more cohesive objects, but also the presence of fieldwork rapidly increased until more depth related objects formed filigran patterns, centered color gradient, darker parts at the rim of the monitor filigree type pattern fireworks all over the screen, passing through a tunnel like hyperspace in ""star wars"", doing a flyby of the milky way galaxy,green color on the sides and center of image, kaleidoscope type patterns First a butterfly shape. Afterwards geometric swirling shapes. My visual noise (existent condition) got worse during and afterwards. First a mandala building from center to edge, then neon bars in different places on the screen, over the mandala but with a symmetry having nothing to do with the mandala form. The bars would change length (but never width). The mandala started rotating with the random neon bars appearing and also small fuzzy balls. 

The mandala became more structured and geometric and began to form into  objects, ""robots"", other kinds of images (a la minecraft). Then the depth of the space increased and it was like I was watching a road or train tracks speeding past as I looked down on it. There was a sense of ""tunnel"".

This began to interchange with relatively ""blank"" spaces with curving lines, very much the shape of a ( , but larger scattered in a much more random pattern than the mandala. More like a Kaleidoscope.

Then the images started ""repeating"". Not literally or exactly, but the sequence of types of images started over. I watched those for a couple of minutes and when nothing new was happening I stopped at about the 7 minute mark. First a mirror, then horse then horse portrait  First a starburst in the middle, like the eye of Sauron. The screen began to move in small circle. Crackles, like a crumbled then smoothed paper. Dark purple once. And I saw the door! an arched door, like from a church or castle.  First came the geometries, then symbols, they all kept floating still in their areas of the screen. After 40 seconds or something, I saw a bright light in the middle and it started gravitating in circles around the screen, first in the horizontal axis, then all around the screen whilst all the other ""symbol geometries"" came flying with it, as if it was a planet pulling everything to its movement, kind of like satellites following it. After a minute and a half I started feeling a very unpleasant feeling and thought that if I kept staring, I'd be sent to another dimension? Something weird, so I had to stop it. All in all it was a difficult, yet cool experience. First changing colors, then swarms of dragonflies, then wildflowers and dragonflies plus butterflies first changing radiation pattern, gradually the screen become larger and other colors come in, and complex pictures show up but dont have time to look carefully and then my screen saver is activated first geometrical objects grids, stars and then cartoon like drawings, more complex shapes and eventually cityscapes evolving into space and producing wavelike patterns  first greens, then yellows, then silver-white letter-like shapes, then 6, then 5, then a scrolling through different numbers in that spot; more similar things over time. First I felt a looming sensation, as if the screen were getting larger as I watched. This soon alternated with simple pulsing geometric shapes (circles, triangles, arcs) and patterns (checkerboard, stripe). Then came strong sensations of optic flow, as if I were being carried along a tunnel or path, or moving along next to a wall. I developed a sensation of green and blue, which resolved into the sensation of a forest (however, I didn't feel that I ""saw"" the trees, but I had the sense that they were there). This went back to geometric shapes, and scintillating concentric rings, before developing into a sense of vertical energy--which my mind coded as a skyscraper (even though, again, I didn't ""see"" the skyscraper as I would with mental imagery). Then back to geometric shapes and patterns. (One caveat is that my monitor went to sleep a couple of times while I was viewing the ganzflicker, but I found that the imagery came back rapidly after waking the monitor up.) First I saw a corridor full of closed doors.  At the end was a person standing there with light behind him.  I didn’t know who it was but was trying eagerly to get a better view.  Suddenly everything changed into a strobing heart.  I thought it was me thinking of you and tried to not focus on you to avoid feeling primed.
Then in the blink of an eye I saw two sumo wrestlers giving their one foot, two foot, ready, set, go!  They smashed into each other over and over until finally one overcame the other.  The two of them began tumbling out of control down a slope and hit a guard rail or something because they stopped with a squish and jiggle.  I could only see bare skin and then, “Vooomp!” They were sucked into the background like an elephant being sucked into a straw.  But not only the wrestlers, the whole screen.  And then the whole screen again, and again, over and over.  After a short moment, I realized I was looking at a flower blooming in reverse.  My screen went dark and I had to move the mouse.  At that point I saw something very different.  A face staring back at me.  It wasn’t human.  It looked like a lizard, a serpent.  It was trying to talk to me but all I could focus on was it’s eyes.  A moment later it took off flying and I could tell it was a dragon.  The dragon kept flying faster and faster, starting to do barrel rolls close to me so that the strobing was actually the wings rolling past me with great speed.  The dragon disappeared and instantly reappeared flying loops around me with the same veracity.  It felt like something was about to happen, I felt like it was circling tighter and tighter.  Then the white noise stopped and I was pulled out of the trance
 First I saw a few lines varying in orientation from either end of the screen. Then I began to see circles. The circles became more and more, resembling a birds-eye-view of a drop of water dropped into waters, appearing to be quite realistic for short durations. A lot of lines and axially symmetrically shapes appeared. Towards the end of the experiment, I witnessed said fast rotating spirals, with one end of the spiral disc being closer to me than the other end. At some point I was in between two sprialing discs. Some spiraling discs wandered further into the background. first i saw a pink lotus opening. Then I saw some green amorphous shapes. Then there was an eye in the center that turned down on the left side. Then the eye slid diagonally down the screen First I saw a woman riding a bike on a shady path and falling to one side. The image changed to one of a woman sitting in a hard plastic chair in a rectangle room, her skin was made of something clear and gelatinous like jello. She morphed into a nude woman sitting on the grass crying. After that I began to see more landscape type visuals of rolling hills and tall grass. Oddly disfigured or alien animals kept appearing in the landscape with looks of happiness or anguish on their faces. The last thing I saw was a horse with the eyes of a human galloping across a plateau and staring at me sideways. First I saw stick figures, like cave paintings, then it morphed into landscapes, fields with stone walls.  I could see the fields were green even though the red and black were dominating First I saw this white colored ball with lines coming out of it, and at it's centre it started getting brighter with a yellow like color and expanding. It then seemed to explode into what looks like a galaxy, similar to how the milky way looks. Then it started getting more vivid (more color and looked more realistic), and transitioning into mechanical looking objects. Some looked like they were made with steel or titanium, with one looking like the imperial star destroyer (from star wars) without anything protruding from the top and a hollow triangle shape in the middle. Some looked like a tall glass chamber like some nano gram scales. 

Then it transitioned into these 2d square shapes that looked like they were tied together with lines, inside them they had another square perfectly centred and then the same again. After that it seemed to quickly come together and explode into multiple colors covering the screen seperated by lines. I stopped after that because it was getting uncomfortable after about 60-90 seconds. First I saw two vertical and parallel lines, which later separated into pieces and started swirling around creating a circle. As the circle girated I could also see shapes in the center spin. First an X then a plus sign, then an asterix (both). After it spun for a while the circle slowed down, it decomposed itself to spinning the DNA helix shape until it further decomposed and slowed down to form the 2 parallel lines at the beginning. First I saw what looked like neural synapses and then I saw what looked like ripples in the water first I was very close to the screen and it was flickering in grey and red, then red and blue, the blue phases seemed to become longer. After a while I moved my head farther away from the screen, the blue disappeared, it was mainly red, sometimes with yellow and white areas. Now I started to see patterns. I saw balls (later circles) of light, sometimes one in the center, sometimes several. Sometimes the patterns were symmetrical - same patterns on the left and on the right half of the screen, somethimes it was chaotic. Later there were shadow-like greyish darker objects with long rounded shapes like rounded off dark bars moving fast in a row, like all running after each other in one direction. Sometimes the light seemed to become larger and radiate out of the size of the screen, the shape of the screen seemed to change constantly, sometimes the image seemed to rotate. Towards the end, the screen had a sharp and clear outline on the outside but on the inside there was like a thin dark bordure that looked like lace or foam or small bubbles. This bordure was quite stable, it stayed for a long time, also when I moved my eyes or my head - until I turned on the light in the room and closed the tab. First it was a silhouette of a theater mask morphing into a face immediately. Then I got scared so I turned it off. Then the second time I tried it, I saw first a big flame in the middle. And inside the middle of the flame was a dancing figure. When I blinked another image came where there are the flickering embers of fire escaping the body of fire itself. And my view started going Lower and lower into the fire until I can see it expanding out to show a group of kids sitting around the campfire only for the fire to change into a small one inside a lantern. First it was black strips, but I would move my eye trying to count the straps and than images began to form. Buildings or trees mostly but I blinked and I saw an elephant every time I had to blink I saw an elephant on the screen when I opened my eyes again  First light in the form of lines, outline side profile, semi frontal face First lines then balls of lightning around my periphery. After about 5minutes there was enough lines to make a forest like outline that was greenish but changed colors often, different shades of green, black, brown, and gray First mostly a grassy field. I could definitely see blue, green, and orange in addition to the black and red.  Then it changed to white splashes of light, dots, and lightning. Then 3D geometric shapes all over the place.  Like I could reach out and touch them.  A field of grass always appeared just above the screen, like in my living room. first saw a bunch of something fractal-like, but not quite that gradually began to become rounder and rounder, then. when it got fully round, it was as if an solid point was brighter in the middle of the fractal than the rest of the screen (this followed my gaze). 
Eventually it transformed into a thing rotating that were ""shooting laser"", (kinda like a plasma ball but in 2 d and with only 1 to 4 lines that has the plasma ball beam's behavior) from the gaze to the border of my screen
enventually, it was as if i was going through a tunnel kinda like this image : https://c8.alamy.com/comp/R7JDW8/flight-over-neon-light-tunnel-cyberspace-wormhole-sci-fi-space-travel-3d-render-motion-design-of-spaceship-warp-flight-R7JDW8.jpg where i was looking was affecting the angle of the tunnel altho it kept changing randomly. i wasn't sure if my screen was doing some weird flicker things so i stepped away, looked from a distance and noticed the lack of all those black pattern. sometime, it felt like it was just because of my screen refresh rate, but after doing that, im not so sure anymore. First some very faint green dots, then some very faint blue dots mixed in.  After a while the began to rotate in sort of a swirl. They were so faint, it was hard to tell if I was really seeing them. First there were shapes of a heart that was pulsing and morphing into other shapes. Like an X or a circle. Then a person's face appeared. His head was shaking about. I could only see half of his torso and shoulders. Eventually he started slamming his head against the screen. Harder and harder. His facial features began to become more vivid. Then he turned and started choking someone. And was grabbing his head and slamming into onto the floor. That's when I stopped watching it. I couldn't take anymore of it. Was making me feel sick.  First there were various shapes that seemed to get larger and larger and then engulf me, one after another. The shapes got progressively more complex; they started as diamonds and circles and then turned into spider webs and bow ties. When the 10 minutes was almost up I began to see outlines of figures or very specific objects. First thing I remember was seeing something like a lightning storm, followed by a giant mushroom in the storm. Went to the underside of the mushrooming looked up. After that saw a lady with a hat and a weird face, followed by a mountain  First, a landscape, looking over a cliff from a mountain onto a valley, and more mountains in the background, with lots of trees. This persisted quite a while. Then long spider legs spiraling into the image, consuming it. Then the galaxy, edge on, sometimes rotating upwards. Many of space. Then it would all go ""blank""---this happened several times. Sometimes it would take a while for it to start again, but never so detailed or specific as the mountain scene. Lots of kaleidoscopic images moving extremely fast. The most disturbing part was halfway through. I realized I had been staring in the center and not looking at the edges. I moved my eyes to the right and realized that the circle swirl I had been watching in the center moved with my eyes. I thought it couldn't possibly be following me. So then I moved to the left, then right, then left and center---and it followed me. I became very uncomfortable and it must have ""broken the spell"" because it disappeared and never returned. At the height of my discomfort, I was convinced that it wasn't following me, but I was controlling what I was watching---my observation was determining what I was seeing. Well, yes, but I didn't think it would respond so strongly. First, geometric shapes, but they went by too fast to identify.  Then a great point, rising up from the bottom to the top of the screen.  Nothing for a little while, then what seems like bubbles, shooting past me as if I was travelling at warp speed through space. first, indistinct motion, like trying to see someone moving in shady trees.
next, polka dots flashed on the left half of the screen.
A skull, iconic not realistic
A squiggly alligator, that became a car and drove off up a city street lined with buildings, all like it was drawn by Harold, with his purple crayon, although these lines were black.
Blue triangles.
Rotating tunnels, leading into the screen, repeatedly Firstly i saw a human's eye after that it's changed to an eagle's eye. The image went away and I saw the eagle more clearly. In very short moments, I saw a human form with horns. Firstly i saw shapes then ,long coridor and asian language  Firstly I saw what looked like trees, arching over , palm trees, this morphed into a vaulted cathedral roof, then a tree lined avenue.

After a respite i saw what looked like insect parts, bees bodies with blurred flying wings, either very large or I was close in, like a macro lens.

Other insect parts - moths antenna - the feather-like ones. mandibles.

then teeth, like skeletal jaws. 

finally it was like looking off the back of a speeding train as the line and subway disappeared into the distance.

 Firt it looked like fan blades spinning, then a kaleidoscope with red and blue. After a couple minutes more the center looked like a large bird or dragon flapping it's wings slowly, like it was a very large animal. This morphed into a sort of side view that looked more blood a red butterfly, though no discernable features on either. Like it was blurry or distant.  fisrt geometric patterns in grren, brown, black and red ( a bit like multiple small mandala arragend into a full screen pattern, mostly round shapes), 2 pairs of eyes left and right on the screen, the monoitor seemd to move closer a few times, seeing a blond boy flyning along a stoney tunnel (like superman), walking trouugh a stone portal (like a castle) and walking down its stony grey corridors, a dacncing girl shaking her hipps morohed into a kitchen aid stiring dough Fists coming down, someone crying, a murder, etc Flares, Grey and sometimes Blue color, Maze, rotating ""sticks""/""keys"" flash  Flashed yellow during first 3 or so minutes Flashes mostly star bursts cross hairs andfirework type explosions Flashes of colours..blue, yellow, green
 Flashes of different colors Flashes, light explosions (as in a video game or animated show, not the obvious flashing from red to black, and not realistic explosions), moving simple objects with afterimages, different colors (blue and green), moving cones of light, regular vertical banding, and after a while anything I was thinking about. Flashing blobs of purples and blues that resembled an oversaturated rorschach test, with a faint grid in the background. Pulsing band of yellow at the perimeter of the screen. And venting static flowing away from the edges of the screen, similar to what you might see in a Tool video. Flashing lights Flashing lights Flashing lights Flashing of white color like lightning on all periphery of my phone screen and my face because screen is like mirror Flashing orange and dark screen, sometimes seemed to be scrolling left or right. Flashing X patterns that slowly started to spin counter-clockwise until a small portion of the screen was a spinning spiral. The flickering also seemed to slow down drastically as if time was slowing down flickering Flickering betwyred black and white  flickering colors, lights and shapes Flickering colours were many colours and constantly changing around. Images were from the middle and like were they were forming then growing from the middle before starting again and evolving. Like a heart shape, then a cross, then the cross spinning, then it’s like a tunnel one way, then it spun the otherway. The background colour changing. These images were not very vivid and took awhile to start beyond just the red and black. The blue and yellow flickers started first.  flickering light sometimes a very faint images couldn't make it properly though Flickering red and orange light Flickering red light, pulses varied, tried to identify  a repetitive pattern but couldn't. I found it irritating so didn't complete the 10 mins. Flickering streaks and scratches as if watching old movie reel Flickering turning into pulsing in various directions Flickers of lines and webs  Flicking lights converging into the center like travelling through space floaters, 2 triangles pointed towards each other in an hourglass shape, the Hebrew Tree of Life diagram, capital letter ""A,"" a starburst, the screen seemed to changed from mostly red to a dark orange. Flower, colors, river, waterfall, hearth shape Flowers growing, animals walking in parade flowers, circles and shapes, automobiles, clouds, devil horns Flowers, crosses, equals sign, Washington monument-type shape, a pretty vivid giraffe, thin purple lightning at the end, the colors orange, blue, and green a little. Not crazy vivid, but interesting to see some outlines Flowers, landscapes with an open sky and almost like lightning bursting through Flowers, like zinnias, opening in various areas if the screen. A hallway in the distance the seemed to open up in the center if the screen and move upward, then a figure walking through.  Flowery webs that are growing out of the screen and some trails like water drips diagonally across the right side of the screen Flowing and weaving patterns. Red & green colours. When I closed my eyes there were very clear purple & yellow moving geometric patterns.  Flowing, shifting geometric patterns — most often V shapes, inverted Vs, rapidly spinning circles or spirals, or Xs — that sometimes seemed to expand beyond the edges of the monitor.
Occasionally, one of the patterns, especially the circles and spirals, would briefly register in my mind as a spinning circular room with elaborate columns around the periphery before I lost focus or had to blink and the image was gone. Flying 1st person perspective, birds Flying, horses running, 2 silhouettes in conversation, supernovas Flying past mountains on the left, then flying past them on the right, each mountain different size/shape than the previous Flying through tunnels with checkerboard walls, or twisting around checkerboard landscapes in space, like old 1980s computer graphics; flying over an ocean, zooming forward, until there was a faint city on the horizon; several indistinct faces hiding, fading in and out like they were shy, sometimes lingering a little longer or opening their eyes to peer curiously out of the screen; whirlpools of light, sometimes one, but usually two or more; a girl standing under a tree in the rain, holding an umbrella with lace around its fringe, looking down at the ground. Most were faint patterns, but the last one was more distinct. for a few seconds I saw this line of light as a thunder (very brief though) For about 2 minutes I saw colors other than black and red, and after a few minutes I saw the face of my loved one."

It looked like watching many spinning tops from various angles - some side on, some from the top, and some from in between. Their speeds varied and so did their size. I also saw outlines of things like snakes, an acorn, a plane, trees, eyes, what looked like an erupting volcano. They were not like the full pictures you can imagine of something, but more like the background stuff in a dream - it  didn't completely look like those things, but it did enough that they felt recognisable as objects (like when you see a cloud that looks like a person or something). Sometimes everything looked like the close up of scales on a snake that was moving very fast. Sometimes it looked like lots of birds all together, and sometimes it looked like a few birds in outline. Once I saw what looked like a face opening its eyes slowly at me before its eyes got bigger and bigger before they disappeared because it had ""zoomed in"" so much. The most ""realistic"" things were when it looked like the sea - a very sea-like blue, and all the patterns from froth on the surface. Something that lasted a long time was the image of two cogs/gears engaged with each other and moving at various speeds. I could see something other than black and red for the whole time, but how detailed/recognisable as things they were varied a lot. It was always very bright, but it wasn't very detailed. For the first 10 Minutes I saw nothing but flicker, but I hat the immediate feeling that the flicker grows bigger than the actual screen. Then nothing for minutes. If anything, mostly I saw shapes like spirals or round shapes moving like carousels, vague tunnels, but nothing that clear so I could make out any actual objects. After almost 10 minutes my screeen became more ""three-dimensional"" it was like a big red cube. For the first 30 sec. or so I saw what appeared to be an open door moving across the bottom of the screen from left to right. I then saw alternating patterns of a diamond and an hourglass. Meanwhile the colors began transforming amidst the flashing: a thick blue horizontal line that originated in the upper left and slowly stretched to the right, and a pale green vertical line that covered the right margin of the screen. For the first 4 minutes it was like warping down a square tunnel of changing width and height. At times circles would pop into existence then out again. After 5 minutes or what felt like 5 minutes (the second half of the experience)more complex geometrical environments morphing in and out of one another began to form, Almost like seeing buildings of stone and/or metal morphing shape. The environments were like from carnivals, with merry go rounds, and upside down staircases. Stone columns of marble with moving spiraling hand rails around them.  Stars twinkling in the night sky. Forest section, colorful prisms, twirling colorful prism, shadows morphing Forest, road, flashing dots, patterned pulsing forests and ponds forests, sky, clouds, birds, stag beetle, skull Four lines from the center to the corners. Two wheels rotation against each other. One fan from right side spinning. Sphere in middle. Wave pattern across screen. fractal patterns based on square and circle periodic repetitions and rotations emanating from an origin at infinite depth moving around in the center of the screen, and emanating from the periphery of the screen; a rotating gradient bar which at some point expanded to reveal the gradient was aliasing of fractal patterns; it seemed like the red and blue intervals were changing in time and there was like a hyperbolic phase offset between the patterns which varied periodically around the periphery of the screen Fractal patterns, black and red; a curvy, moving line, clear red Fractal Patterns, Fleets of space ships flying by, claws coming at me, falling down a crevice facing towards the sky, checkerboard, rotating sphere, rotating cylinder fractal shapes across the entire screen, square-ish, like a translucent grid. Maybe 12 x 12. Then lines appeared across the screen, much more substantial, white in color. Then sort of like circles revolving chaotically across the screen up and down. Revolving in terms of at some point becoming straight lines then expanding into ellipses then finally circles. Not always complete but close. Again whiteish, pinkish in color. Fractal shapes spinning and swirling all over the screen. Sometime morphing into balls of lights and moving about the screen. At times the edges of the screen seemed to light up brighter than the rest of the screen and change color slightly. Fractal shapes, geometric patterns, and some color fade Fractal shapes, lightning, ""electric discharges"" Fractal squares in an almost spider-web fashion, colorful circles surrounded by multi-colored static fractal type patterns, primarily x-shaped, almost like looking up through palm tree leaves to the sky, predominantly red & black, but with other colors at times, decreasing in frequency from green, to blue, to pink, to yellow Fractal-like patterns with repeating circles, geometric forms like snowflakes forming. Undulating grids fractals Fractals Fractals Fractals Fractals and gradients fractals and patterns Fractals in a snowflake crystal formation. Constantly zooming in and changing. Yet pattern repeated over and over (seems the flicker is a short loop). As time went on I become more relaxed and then big flashes of blue and yellow shapes with hard edges. And it seems the visualizations started to come further and further out of the screen. fractals spinning ant-clockwise Fractals that changed and came and went, followed by shapes that pulsed and swirling lies that flickered across the screen. Vortexes appeared and i felt like i was being drawn in several times with some feeling of motion. I think i saw a sunrise once. The color sometimes changed.

Several times i saw things grinding against each other, mirror images that rotated against each other.

It hurt my head and started to give me a migraine Fractals, a star shape with the sides moving to form it and stars going down the center of each arm as it grew fractals, circles, webs, strings, hyperdimensional  Fractals, cubes, multiple people on fire burning to death, a demon's face and later a skull, spinning discs and spirals, stars, the colours blue and yellow, breasts (POV lying down), first person view of surfing waves, standing on a large cube surrounded by cubes looking down, triangles Fractals, morphing faces (small and large), geometric shapes, flowing colours Frequently it would seem as if I saw a plane rotating away from me. At first head on, then turned so I viewed it at an angle. I would often be flying through the plane, with it moving above and below me. Sometimes there would be another layer to the moving in a different direction -- like a red waterfall or stream of light vanishing over a planar horizon.

These images would only remain constant for about five seconds at a time before shifting or returning to be flat.

Occasionally I would see something like fractal geometry, intricate repeating details and patterns forming larger scale structures. For example, a spiralling disk that was textured with needle-like protrusions along its surface, almost like hair.

Often I would see several pulsing spheres lying flat against the plane. Sometimes one would move horizontally, like a blur in my vision.

There was also often a primary streak across the middle of the image, like a series of nested V shapes pointing to either my left or right, without depth. I wonder if this was a result of screen-tearing on my screen.

The images would almost always disappear after moving my focus. Frida and lightning strikes ordenend Balla rectangles in different shapea constantly Channing en 3 dimensions en glowing shapes Fully black square grid lines (perfect simetry) with small black balls moving in a round pattern furry animals, fireworks, geometric patterns, usually lined in blue Future spiritual events for the world lining up and beginning. Archangel Michael. Ocean. People in hushed awe. Then whirling vortex while it all comes down.  Fuzzy black spot in center, white/blue dots in horizontal linear arrangement a bit like sky sprites galaxy and stars and starship around the unıverse galaxy shapes in different planes, dots in grids, crossing of lines in the middle, different diagonal lines morphing into eachother gear wheels, galaxies, balls General shapes which later turned into landscape like mountains or hills generally a mix and match of shapes, primarily a cross (x) on the screen flashing green, with lines and the vortex appearing once or twice in the whole time. Generally looked pinker or whiter as my eyes got tired; border of monitor became more blurry/gelatinous as if the screen was bulging; sparkles, short line segments like mud cracking, swirls. No images or pictures appeared. geometric flashes like tiny exploding windmills constantly whirring - but very faint and mixed up with the general pulsing light Geometric images began to emerge immediately, then colors began to change and morph, then I began to ""see"" or rather, feel the sensation of being in my childhood home's front yard on a hot summer day with the sun beating down through the trees. geometric images often of blues and greens geometric images, lattices, rolling balls, interference patterns, fans Geometric lines Geometric patterns as you'd see through a kaleidoscope but without the color. Patterns shown through black and red  geometric patterns browns and grey colors Geometric patterns like a Celtic knot  Geometric patterns like shards, of varying sizes and shapes, 'wire'rathern than solid. These were grey and were constantly moving abut, poping in and out of view. many of them for at least half the screen are, radiating from the center. These were psersistent, though that depended on how much my fous drifted out (and at one point I went completely cross-eyed). So they wree morte opr less present depending on my focus. Half way through they were joined by, or sometimes replaced by, coloured blobs of indistinct geoemetric shape - oranges and dark greeen/blue/grey. Geometric patterns morphing into other geometrical shapes, moving as if going through a tunnel. Geometric patterns moving.  Geometric patterns of pink and green Geometric patterns of shapes moving in linear directions across the screen and others rotated around an unknown axis.  Sometimes it put me to sleep to be honest even with the white noise.  I also saw blackish micro-artifacts gobbling the screen from the sides at times.  This reminds me of times watching the dawn arise on the road when I have been driving all night after being awake all day or drove for Uber/Lyft from night to day to late night early morning again.  The dark would eat things in my vision. geometric patterns with tiny diamonds or arrowhead shapes fromin patterns, connected with fine lines. pattern was black with inside of diamonds and arrowheads black. Pattern varied over time, some spirals and curves, some more angular or rectangular. The patterns flashed on and off quickly, replaced by flash of black color. After several minutes the dark flash in between patterns was dark blue rather than black, with occasional flashes of green. The flashing of geometric pattern vs. more solid color was regular and very fast, moment to moment. the geometric patterns varied, some were still, others were in motion. The last couple of minutes I began to see more of a regular checkerboard sort of pattern flashing on and off. Geometric patterns, veins, bee hive pattern, fractals  geometric patterns.  later on, geometric swirls of motion, which contained faces.  Some of them were screaming.  They had a Max Headroom look to them.  Geometric patters that made me feel like I was zooming through a tunnel towards a bright white/red spot.  The shapes were on the sides of the tunnel. geometric patters, grids in dark colors, the background was lighter. Colors were only red and black at first, shifted immediately to variations of pink/orange (background) and blue/green (grid shapes). Complimentary shades, but always dark grid on light background. The shapes were easy to see, but flicking so not steady. Patterns shifted and ranged from horizontal lines with random weight and distribution, to grids similarly random but also never chaotic. Very symmetrical. Geometric shape divided horizontally and equal shapes on top and bottom  geometric shapes Geometric shapes Geometric shapes  Geometric shapes (Square,rectangle), Roads, number 67, text cc Geometric shapes and colors yellow blue and green Geometric shapes colored black and yellow into blue and green all over the screen  Geometric shapes in blue and yellow Geometric shapes morphing into circles, rippling waves across the screen, pulsing shapes, mathematical symbols, suns and celestial bodies orbiting one another, 3D cone-like shapes with a circle spinning around inside and various lines and obscure shapes. Most of the patterns were repeating. Thinking about specific things changed the shapes, but into what I was thinking about. Geometric shapes morphing into more complex patterns. The experience ranged from people dancing to space stations Geometric shapes rotating geometric shapes that formed and reformed at different scales, white gray and black swirling lines in the edges of the shapes, rainbow colored dots at times and when i closed my eyes Geometric shapes that were turquoise in color Geometric shapes twisting and turning inside other geometric shapes, clockwise and counter-clockwise simultaneously, circles/squares/many-sided-gons/triangles, comets racing across the screen, ice cubes spilling out of square buckets, birdwings flapping across the screen with each feather's contour and outline delineated. geometric shapes with purplr Geometric shapes, hexagonal symmetry focused at the center of the screen.  Geometric shapes, hyperbolic geometry, checkers pattern of various colors. Also some kind of wave (realistic) Geometric shapes, rotating geometric patterns, triangle forming in the middle of the screen, gone through a tunnel made up of circles, screen warping. geometric shapes, screen moving around Geometric shapes, starting with large squares, then hexes, and back, eventually the blood vessels in my eyes, and all accompanied by pixilation in my peripheral vision, making extremely sharp vision of my surroundings, with occasional interruptions from my blinking.

 Hazy patterns, mostly hexagons.

Hexagonal shapes,like a beehive, with electricity pulsating through them. Also saw red and green instead of red and black during the first few minutes. Hexagons  Hexagons interposed on one another like the shell of a turtle, pulsing out from the center Hexagons, like honey comb, There was something monolithic or tower like but didn't really resolve. hexagons, stripes, broken lines Hexagons/spider-web patterns initially then symmetrical black dots in a series of circles about the centre, then a grey/blue wave of colour from bottom left to half-way across screen.  during the whole time (after about the first minute), the flashing would appear to speed up to approaching 3 times the original rate, this is usually when the black dots would appear, when it slowed the black dots faded out. hhh Hhh high speed in tube travels highly personal, but mostly recallable hmm Hole, mouth, face
 Honestly I saw a red horizontal rectangle...that got more thin the longer I watched. No images. Alas. Honeycomb effect, sometimes rotation, mostly anticlockwise. Sometimes horizontal formation.  Colours such as royal blue, green and yellow. Honeycomb pattern, lines like a microscopic worm  repeated like in diagonal band , blue color in a corner diffused , bloops of different sizes moving around usually red color , a yellow point like a sun rising… Honeycomb patterns and some blue and green streaks of color flickering in center with an X  pattern  honeycomb patterns on the outer rims morphing into rows of orbs that moved into the center honeycomb patterns, train with silhouettes of people going past, waves rolling in on beach, very orange then yellow pulsating,  honeycomb structures, symmetrical bubbles grouped together, circles on circles rotating, a deciduous tree honeycomb, kaleidoscope, the sun w rays streaming away from it, circles, a tunnel honeycombs, patterns of spheres moving in different directions, helix movement, bicycles Horizontal and vertical black bar lines, white spots, a sun like image that radiated outward lines in a wave like form, rippled flat space with alternating high and low spots, bars of prismatic white light (other than black and red), hints of underlying structure I could never materialize in my minds eye.  Horizontal lines of flickering red and black initially, then would turn into a flickering checkerboard. Then the checkerboard would turn into shard-like lines and dots that spun like a fan, then morphed into straight-line red and faint black lines in a circle like if you were laying down staring up at a ceiling fan.  Horse, train tracks (like I was sitting at the front of the train looking out), space (stars and planets), a bicycle wheel turning, doctor who travelling tunnel, screen predominantly turned dark blue with flashes of purple.   horses, warriors, the house of my grand mother Houses, street, some things out my past, space, caleidoscopic flowers, a field. Huh Human Faces, a tower, a cross, a lone outpost in a field of ice Human forms, geometric patterns Humans I almost immediately saw eyes in the center of the screen that looked kind of real, but more like a graphic. I occasionally saw a single eye pop up every now and then for a couple seconds after that. I mostly saw geometric shapes/lines that were constantly in motion. During what felt like the middle of the experience it looked like I was speeding through a tunnel or railroad track, and then like I was jumping into hyperspace in space. Every time I blinked, the images stopped and/or changed. I always saw the same red, blue, black and sometimes yellow hues flickering. I saw two fans on each opposing corner of the screen rotating, then something that looked like an eye coming from the center of the screen and getting larger and larger, and then going upwards or downwards. Sometimes it felt like I was traveling through a tunnel. Other times it felt like I was in floating a room and it was changing directions, as if I was looking at that old Windows screenprotector where you navigate a maze. I had the sensation that the screen grew larger, and sometimes it grew a bit larger even. Sometimes I saw different textures which gave the appearance as if different shapes were carved on the screen. I am somewhat photosensitive in general so I wasn't sure I would be able to do it. When it first started, it was very uncomfortable to look at, but for the first few seconds I saw a flickering red and black screen with an afterimage of bluegreen with each flicker. After those first few seconds, it was like the red tinged a little darker, and I could see three or four bright red lines running through it. I kept blinking a lot because of the discomfort, which was messing up the illusion. After a minute or so, it was less uncomfortable so I was able to keep my eyes open for a few seconds at a time, and I started seeing a kind of swirling pattern in the bluegreen, and the bluegreen coloration started getting easier to see. I started being able to force my eyes to stay open more normally, and the swirling pattern began to get more intense, and eventually I could no longer perceive the screen itself flickering at all, it was just a solid red screen with a blinking, swirling pattern in it that ""reset"" with each blink. By reset, I mean the vortex would change direction, the pattern would change(from a fan blade appearance to swirling lines and back, mostly), it would flicker more or less frequently, etc. Because I could no longer perceive the screen flickering, it was a lot easier to relax and sit back and let the illusion flow because it wasn't bothering my eyes so much. Nothing really seemed to be changing for a minute or so, just the same swirling pattern that reset any time I blinked. If I held my eyes open, all that would happen was the whole screen filled with a lightly flickering bluegreen color that was swirling slightly. I was about to give up and come to the survey when I started seeing bright red and blue green edges surrounding the outside of the screen, like a glitch affect you would see in a movie or video game. So I settled in to see what else would happen. Very quickly after that, I started to see wavy bluegreen lines around my vision that kind of gave the illusion of things in my peripherals stretching and glitching out, but it was a very mild affect that didn't have much reality to it; it would clear as soon as I blinked or even just moved my eyes slightly. However, within a minute or two tha vortex started stretching out beyond the screen(which still had a glitchy kind of haze around the edges) and it started combining its edges with the wavy lines I was seeing. That's when it started to get trippy, because NOTHING was clearing up when I blinked anymore. It still kind of reset, but it didn't go away. I could shift my eyes around the area of the screen, and the affect was still there. Everything within my field of vision was pulsing and being stretched into this illusory vortex. The audio I could hear even started habing this sort of pulsating affect where it lowered in pitch in pulses within the visual. Over the next minute or so it just kept getting more ""solid"" and real-looking, until finally it was ramping up my anxiety (I am diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder that I do take meds for) and I finally for the first time looked completely away from the screen and up at the ceiling, which instantly got rid of the outside-the-screen illusion, but in my peripherals I could still see a slight vortex and the bluegreen affect in the TV screen. While looking away, I blinked a few times and looked back. The illusion had backtracked to where there was a pulsating bluegreen vortex maintained within the screen with bright red lines running through it. The idea of continuing gave me anxiety, so I decided to stop and complete the survey. I'm not sure exactly how long it was; I think it was less than ten minutes but I'm not positive. I forgot to check the time when I started watching it. I basically saw a bunch of swirling patterns and colors, and then some of what looked like ""color static"" that was blue and pink. I began seeing squares that formed into a grid, constantly shifting and moving, within the first minute. They appeared to me as either red or black, but in the borders between I saw blue, white, yellow, possibly other colors too. This grid of squares was acceleration toward me, spreading out at my periphery, like going through a tunnel. Then, the squares became galaxies and it became a journey through space. The “tunnel” twisted left, right, all around and I could see ahead what turns were coming up.  I bird getting bigger then flying away I can feel everything, the forest, the sound of that and the birds, the humidity and the cold weather, the hight of the trees and the vivid colour of the nature or the texture of the grass,  for example. I feel very relaxed, It was like I was stayed there. Sorry for my english, I talk in spanish :). i cant describe I clearly remember what I saw.ı often saw trees, sun and lightning. I also saw a notebook and Man.  i could only see how the screen was moving from the inner side to the outside hut unfortunately nothing  else  I could see images (Faces), but only if I kept focus on a point and 'wanted' to find something in the flashes. Images didn't appear involuntary.  I could see the colours in a 3d environment, also I could see more red, or more black if I concentrated. It became like looking into a tunnel I could see what looked like sunlight through the stained glass. There was a metallic haze that swirled around like the wind was blowing it. The haze would catch all the colors from the stained glass, and little sparkles of color were everywhere, floating and making swirls in the air. I could slowly make out a small alien face. I did not enjoy the experience as it hurt my eyes.  I couldn't make out what it said but it seemed to be a paragraph of words I couldn't view it long enough due to nausea being triggered. Red 8s a bad colour to use for the experiment. Blue would be better. 
I've seen way better patterns with LSD. I deliberately alternatingly imagined a rising or falling diagonal line, and then also saw it exactly as imagined I did it twice. First time in the evening with the beside light on, and I saw my own reflection, which was probably an actual reflection in the tablet screen. Second time in a dark room, I saw shapes and strings, things like that. Both times I stopped after 6 minutes as the whole experience was unpleasant and giving me a headache, making my eyes feel tired as well. I did the whole exp using N2O and had some vivid basic shape images while listining to white noise. Very intense and extended exprience than usual but far far far away from ayahuasca ou magic truffle. Not feeling the psycodelic effect other than a brain trick. A nice one btw I didn’t see images, but there was an incredible depth of field to the screen, like it was a 3D box. It reminded me of a magic eye image. If I stared without blinking I saw nothing but colours (mostly red, but also lots of green and some turquoise and orange), but if I blinked rapidly I could see faint geometric patterns (turquoise circles in rows on an orange-red background). If I closed my eyes and opened them again the patterns changed to smaller circles/dots I didn't really see much, nothing crazy at least. But the amounts of red and black shifted a lot. Like, sometimes black would start creeping in from the edges until almost the whole screen was black with a reddish shade and a circle of red in the middle. Or, like the opposite, everything would lighten up to almost white but with a red tint to it, super bright. A couple times, it looked like I was falling through a warp portal and it looked 3d, popping out from the screen. I didn't see a variety of things, so I can say that I remember most of it I didn't see anything other than the flicker. Slowly the black flashes began to appear vividly blue. I found the experience uncomfortable and was unable to watch for longer. "

But then I saw the answer choices ""shapes or patterns"" like streaks of light or spiderwebs and realized that what i was seeing might have actually been part of the hallucinatory experience. I directly saw pink, purple, and yellow lines, but in my mind there was an image of the interior of what appeared to be an old, open-concept Scandinavian house, with wood floors, wood paneling, a bench with a white cushion on the right, and a bar separating the front door/""hall"" from the kitchen on the left. But I did need to physically move my eyes to look around. It was a very peaceful-seeming environment. At one point, I had an image of a green, trollish person with two horns coming in the front door. It sounds menacing, but it felt comforting. I don't know. It was just odd, like a very faint iTunes visualizer.  I feel my visual perception was being influenced by what I felt at that moment, which was uncomfortable. I felt I was being terrorized. so my mind began to make up an interrogation room scene. it triggered memories of violent scenes from movies I felt like I saw lines of lightning... and sometimes flashes of yellow and blue.  It was very quick though, almost to the beat of the flashing.  I felt like I was at a river and the water rushing was so loud that I couldn't hear myself think. I was standing in the water, and my bare feet were slipping on the stones as I looked at the sky. The sky was on fire and I knew there were explosions in the distance. It felt like the world was ending. I made it stop before ten minutes.  I felt like I was in a trance when I focused and didn’t let my eyes shift around. The lights morphed into patterns like a kaleidoscope.  I felt screen poping out like the colour getting larger than the screen size. And something like red colour spiralling through/in the screen. I felt the screen expanding and getting closer, faint shapes forming and new colors that felt cold but not easily described by words. I didn't want to stop, I blinked way less often than ordinary. I wanted to keep my eyes open as long as possible. I figured the white noise wasn't a full ten min because it felt like I was just watching for a couple minutes. It freaked me out to see it was 10min that has gone by. I first began seeing shapes like diamonds, lines descending and ascending, mid lines waving back and forth across the screen, I saw the color green, and then round lines wavering vertically down the screen. The first object I saw was a soccer ball. I could see that it was not two dimensional. The designs of each little hexagon on the ball was clear. I saw it twice and both times it rose to the top of the screen when I saw it. The outlines of butterflies came next. They floated quickly upward. Then I saw a random small monkey riding something up in the top right quarter. I think I also saw rows of sheep as if looking down from above.  I first noticed that the red and black flashes desynchronized so it appeared to be a chaotic pattern of red and black appearing at once. The most vivid image was a symmetrical cross made up of one line top to bottom across the screen, and one line horizontal across the screen. I saw some oblong round shapes, one that was eye or almond shaped, and one that was more oval. Both were around the edges of the whole screen. I briefly saw dark blue instead of black. Once, the flicker appeared to happen in a wave starting in the upper right corner and propagating diagonally across the screen. Towards the end, it seemed like red was the default, and black just appeared in irregular and chaotic flashes. All of the phenomena I saw felt more neurological than psychological - like I was experiencing visual artifacts of how my eyes were taking in light, rather than anything meaningful or creative. I first saw a grid-like pattern, like I was flying through a 3D grid. That gave way to swirling hurricane-like systems move across the screen, like viewing the atmosphere of Jupiter. Those would morph into diagonal streaks that were jagged and sharp. Those would then morph into kaleidoscopic fractals of circles moving and spinning, starting as circular shapes then transitioning into sharp triangular shapes. I first saw a shadow figure ploughing like in a shadow theatre. Then I saw receding pyramids with a slow river running right to left, there was a plain left with scrub and trees. It was hot but static, there were no people, just a lazy scene. The pyramids looked Eqyptian but there left bank of the river scrub had no palm trees and I wondered why?  This became a rushing train journey first through forest, headlong downwards. Oddly there was then green and white snow that swirled about the steam engine that I rode at the front. I could hear the train sound (white noise?) but there was too the rush of fir branches crashing down the side of the train. There were also 3-4 white birds flying at 11 oclock alongside the train, close too but unharmed by the trees that they seemed to just fly straight through. I first saw a the flashing, then the shape of a princess dress and is saw some blueish colors. Then I started seeing flashing x shape that took up most of the screen, then on and off I saw spinning circles that would then turn into like a stream of movement from the bottom left to the top right, and it would go back to the spinning circles.  The spinning circles were about 1/4 the size of the video and moved back and forth.  It started with one circle and then turned into two circles. I got the sense that I was looking through a window into a very large featureless room. There was a huge sense of deepness and dimension, even if there wasn't anything in it but diamond shapes and short black lines. I had my eyes closed for comfort and saw images like microscopy of botanic or aquatic plant life with predominantly blue/green colours, When my eyes were open just the red/black flicker but a small white blob moving in the lower right hand corner/edge of screen I had seen movement of the screen getting smaller to bigger throughout the entire time after about 3 min in. I saw shadowy/silhouettes of homes with a typical house shape, as well as flashes of different light hues randomly throughout I had swirls and eddies, entire fields of circles rolling and intersecting, star bursts I have a lagre screen wuhd images notice that images apperance depending on where you sight was focused I have seen my face I haven’t viewed it  I heard indistinct voices in the white noise before I saw anything.  Then the black and red seemed to swirl with yellows and whites. Lightning like flashes arched across the screen in greens and blues.  I immediately saw colors other than red and black-- teal, hot pink, orange mainly. About midway through the screen turned to a bright orange rather than red background and stayed that way. I saw peacock feathers around the perimeter of the screen at one point, a butterfly and peace sign in the middle and then other flashes of images that I can't recall at this point.  I just felt my room spinning around me I just kept seeing a detailed human eyeball with its slowly opening and closing I just saw 2 second, but Im still scared i just saw a road for one or two seconds. I just saw green and pink once in a while during the flashes. I just saw him several balls of light in the grid like pattern I just saw patterns like the ones you see when you look through a kaleidoscope
- just in black and red and less intense, also not as complex. At first I saw something like a black square and later some round patterns forming together bigger patterns I just saw white shapes, lines, crosses est. I just went a bit cross-eyed and got tired. i kept seeing “x”s and other shapes but as if i was going down a long tunnel with that shape at the end. i saw sunsets and rainbows take on different shapes, and saw just general chaos like the pictures of the universe zoomed way out I kept seeing a butterfly flapping its wings and it would morph back n forth between that and a skeletal ribcage breathing. Also felt like I was in a subway trai. Looking out the window at one point it looked like a group of dolphins swimming and jumping out of the water and it would be from far away then zoom in to were only 2 dolphins were on the screen I kept seeing a sun glowing and various grids and geometric shapes in the visual  I kept seeing faces. At one point a animal but I couldn’t make it out. I kept seeing around the edge of the screen a bright rainbow. When it would get faster it seemed as if the screen was stirring or circling. Sometimes it looked like the screen was shaking.  I kept seeing images of a forest and a lake as though through the trees in brief flashes, and in between each glimpse I also saw geometric shapes bursting with colors (mostly yellow, purple, and green) I kind of saw the geometry of an eye with lines around it, like a silhouette, like a hieroglyphic thing. Not really like a real eye but like an oval with points on the sides. I looked at the screen but had a hard time looking into the center of it-- my eyes kept drifting to the top of the screen. I wasn't sure whether I should try to focus or unfocus my eyes.  I made the mistake of watching on a screen that was dusty. The spots of dust became foci from which I saw lines ondulate slowly. I mainly remember the rainbow streaks and I saw a tree I think. The rainbows were either really bright or pretty subtle.  I mainly saw pastel colors in addition to the red and black I managed to do it for almost 8 minutes but it was too painful for my eyes to continue. It was quite dynamic, with small to bigger shapes and patterns emerging and moving across the screen: e.g small colored squares and rhombuses (purple-ish/green-ish, etc) starting tiny and growing in size, or reddish patterns sweeping like a wave across the screen, or gathering in the middle in verticle lines. It was interesting but really painful on the eyes for me. I may try it again without the white noise, perhaps with shaman drumming to see how that goes. the white noise would not have been my preferred sound I mostly perceived the red and black flashing, however it was accompanied by constant black patterns that were mostly fractals but were sometimes circular or web-like. The colors changed at times from red to yellow and a blue-green. It was a blue-green ball that I could follow with my eyes as it either pulsed in the center or moved around the screen. I had some control of this ball of light. I could make it go in a swirl or figure eight pattern. The experience had heightened my vigilance and focusing in on this ball of light and guiding it eased my anxiety so I could last the full ten minutes.  I mostly saw dots of yellow in a circular pattern towards the center. Several minutes in and a spiky black shape formed for several seconds then slipped away. I'm going to try again with a computer and absolute darkness. -SamW I mostly saw flashes of light/black alternating nonstop, in either static looking blocks or in circles or straight lines. Sometimes I saw the visual representation of static like on a television, and other times the screen would 'tear' in horizontal lines or bars. The only thing I saw was a very faint cross shape, like my crosshair in FPS games, that would appear at times in the center of the screen. It would flash on and off, and infrequently it would start spinning very rapidly before disappearing. I didn't see any images, just nonsensical blotches of light red or dark black, alternating nonstop after a few minutes of watching. I had noise cancelling headphones on, and played the 10min of static the entire time. I have a 144hz monitor. I mostly saw geometric shapes like balls, grids, zigzags. In a few instances, I saw blue color at the center of the screen for a few seconds. I could also ""see"" cityscapes occasionally but those did not few like ""real"" seeing (as was the case with the geometric shapes); rather, it was as if I was dreaming – that is, just imagining things while knowing full well they were not on the screen. And, to be honest, maybe I was slightly dozing off, not sure. I mostly saw shifting kaleidoscope shapes at first, but after a while, I saw bats flying from a cave and turning into butterflies. Later, I saw a lightning storm and a bull breathing fire like a dragon. The images were more cartoon-like rather than realistic. i mostly saw two vertical lines, one to the right and one to the left. They made it feel like i was in a room. i also saw a horizontal line that moved from the bottom of the screen to the top of the screen, an then would start again. sometimes i thought the screen looked blue, and other times green. I saw small squares and triangles in the center some of the time. My vision seemed to get very blurry at times and almost make me feel like i was zoned out. It sort of felt like my vision was receding and i was stepping back into a dark place.  I often saw swirling fractal pattens and white lines going horizontal along the centre. The fractal pattens constantly mophed and changed I only looked at it for less than 2 min. fi ocused mostly on my reflection but after like 30 sec I startdetd considering the reflection as another person. I didn't partially like the silahoutte so I focused on  lighted portion which turned out to be a staircase closed gloomy. Type. I tried to Walk forward but that did not help. Apparently I couldn't move anywhere only the picture could move if it wanted. Not sure if it matters  but I have had depression for a while now I only saw black color rotating, transition.  I perceived green areas flashing, no particular shapes. I really saw nothing at all but red and black flickering with blue and green trellis-like pattern when I blinked my eyes I remember feeling unsettled while watching. It made me uneasy and the first time I turned it on, I looked away. However, I picked my phone up and tried to watch again. I remember it was kind of like the screen was moving out of the computer and towards me, taking up most of my vision. I could see complex swirly patterns that were moving. At one point I saw a black background with white stars (like when you draw them) that were moving outwards from a center and swirling. Like that dance with ropes around a pole.  I remember mostly geometrical patterns, squares, mandalas, and some yellow light in the middle. When I closed my eyes I saw similar patterns but with ""negative"" coloring, like the complementary colors in the color wheel, green instead of red for example. I think I saw some kind of door or building entrance, but really blurry, covered in that yellow light, but I feel like it was my mind trying to see something, I'm good with finding familiar shapes or things in abstract patters so I guess after some time looking at the patterns, I started to find some order in the patterns.   I remember one of the first things I could observe was eyes, which were all around the page and looking at me curiously, and perhaps slightly menacingly. I've often felt that sort of thing can be interpreted either way, depending on the mood. In this case, I tried to keep my mood light as I've been feeling somewhat down lately. I wanted to enjoy this and perhaps this actually prevented me from experiencing more intense feelings. I saw geometry, light, and complex patterns that looked like fabrics of geometry and colors and shapes weaving into each other. In my head, I tried to steer my thoughts to process some of the feelings about the end of a romantic relationship I am trying to let go of. I kept trying to see her, talk to her, somehow, but it didn't really manifest in any way. I think it actually helped me realize that it was time to let go. I had smoked & vaporized some cannabis flower and had a bit of beer before as well. I was really nervous before going in as I have tried psychedelics before. This experience was not as intense, but it had some elements that resonated in a similar way. I had a few times where the images did appear to break free of the screen and move towards me. I also felt like I was moving towards the screen at points. Sometimes I would close my eyes and see the wildest patterns, which I found interesting as well but I did not focus on as much because I wanted to recall the experience of looking at the screen. I didn't really get much out of the white noise, though it did perhaps make me focus better. Sometimes I would want to follow a pattern or thought further, but out of fear or carefulness I would stay put. Overall, I'm not sure I delved as deep as I could have, but it was an interesting and enjoyable trip and I'd try it again.  I remember seeing a Dragon's eye, with it's slit pupil widening. Then it goes through a field with many hills, where I arrived at a cave with an opening that had stalagmites reaching the bottom that reminded me of those mouth filters whales have. Then I saw X's turning rapidly, with the letter being formed of dots spaced apart.  I remember seeing a light, then something that looks likes fan, then like a ball moving around the screen. I remember seeing circles that were faint. I also remember seeing faint text that was all scrambled. They were as faint as an eye floater. I remember seeing tunnels forming around the center, orange flashing where there was red, circles interlinked with each other, lines converging on to one point.  I remember some eyes going around,some galaxies colidding,a landscape of the night sky,a battle of swordmans and the solar system. I remember the  colour changing, quite a bit of Green in there I remember travelling through a tunnel I saw 2 to 3 rows of letters.  They were fuzzy and were hard to make out exactly what characters they were. I saw a baby doll face and snowflakes  I saw a ball of light at first and then shapes. Next I saw a city from an aerial view. A castle window with a crow or vulture sitting in the window with a ladder leaning up against it, a forest with skinny tall trees, silhouettes of people, the ocean, animals, objects I had recently looked at around me. I saw a ball of white up near the top left corner, pulsing colors (white and purple), a person figure that climbed from the bottom right to the top left. I saw a black dot in the center than I saw animals outlines and some sort of castle or building and that kept morphing back and forth to animals and buildings I saw a box with writing. The word “extane” & a man, similar to DaVinci’s man but arms not extended.  I saw a bunch of different shapes.  Lots of geometric ones like flowers and stars and then I started to see different stuff.  Like this scary face and I think a dog. I also saw objects but the only thing I remember is a streetlamp that was outside. I saw a calligraphy pen writing. A sword being drawn. Purple color. A red glow. Backing away from a rainbow arch. Mostly was just a light burst right in the center of the screen.  I saw a car driving off slowly, then the screen morphed to geometric shapes and in the middle of it a fox-shaped alien/god/whatever emerged and popped out of the screen. I closed the tab because I was freaking out a little I saw a carousel and the back of a horse's neck, and felt like I was riding on it's back through a forest and into space. I saw a cartoon looking mushroom and then I kept seeing the inside of a daisy like flower and it kept blooming and starting over I saw a checkered board, chevrons, a sun like design with a circle and lightening bolt like rays, and also got a headache (and don't normally get those) I saw a combination of shapes, patterns, bouncing balls, rain, the pov of a rollercoaster ride and a train moving really fast, everything coming out of the screen at me. I saw a constantly changing array of images, ususally repeated in various tile patterns.  The patterns were sometimes grids and sometimes diagonal grids but hexagon shapes occured.  there were brief patterns based on cirles and circles within circles and spirals.   They included people, faces, skylines, an ocean and various other things.  Sometimes the faces were in rows and soetimes the one in the middle would grow larger.  The most frequent color was red but white or blue sometimes took over most of the screen. and black lines sometimes outline the images and somtimes filled the space between images.  The rhythm remained the same throughout.   I saw a demon rabbit that had a knife and intend to kill me. He walked in my direction. I saw a distant window with blinds and curtains. The background was night but I could make out leaves of a tree and the foreground was a table with a bowl or dish centered on the table.  I saw a door open to dancing blue and green snakes  I saw a dragon going through a maze I saw a face a few times on the left side of screen. It wasn't well-defined and I didn't recognize it, but it looked human. I saw the screen spinning and turn into a spiral, which then turned into stars and space. Then the stars started moving like I was traveling through space. Moving through space happened a few times, but in between I saw a car driving on a road. At one point I remember a pencil appearing for a couple seconds. These images/videos would usually last a few seconds and then go away, and in between there'd be shapes and patterns often appearing in a grid all throughout the screen. i saw a face moving morping into scenery  I saw a face of a person screaming I saw a face of an old man, a few furniture-shaped objects, and rays of movement, similar to how a music visualizer would move-- like ripples on a pond. I saw a familiar field of flashing red and black on the monitor.  I pressed f11 to go to full screen. This reminds me very much of the old Shakti-Tech web site flasher software.  I lightly closed my eyes and directed a neutral gaze toward the screen.  I wish I had an old CRT monitor for this, as they work MUCH better than modern LCD monitors.  Then the images began.  There were swirling diamond shapes of red and black, and I started to see yellow or white intersections where the diamonds were merging and dancing in the center of the screen.  The image shifted and became to me like a lady, walking.  I was seeing her pleated white skirt sway back and forth.  There was bright sunlight shining on us.  She's turning and smiling at me, I see her face for a moment.  Then back to the pleats swaying in the dazzling sunlight, making a fan-like pattern.  This shifted again to be more like geometric shapes.  I opened my eyes at this point to check the time.  I had been using the Ganzflicker for about 1-2 minutes at this moment.  I closed my eyes again and resumed.  There were many such swirling patterns, characters, interactions, and suggestions of scenery or terrain but without full-on environments.  I rememeber much more than what I have described here.  It seemed easy to direct the flow, using techniques for lucid dreaming.  But most of the time I held a neutral mindset and let uncontrolled images wash over my perception.  It was fun!  I'd like to try a version of this software with user-adjustable colors and strobe rates. I saw a forest, mainly around the edges of the screen I saw a full spectrum of colors, mostly red, orange, and blue. Near the end it all morphed into brown. At times there appeared random scattered colorful spots, like a swarm of bees, at other times the spots were more organized like a mandala, expanding out in a circular shape from the center. Two times I saw transparent cylinders, a tall one and a short one next to each other in the lower left corner of the screen. I saw a grid that seemed to reach out of the screen. I viewed the Ganzflicker on two monitors at the same time and I noticed that in my peripheral view my mouse cursor seemed to glow bright white and grow and size when i normally have it set to be black and to be quite small. I saw a heart, a bloomy rose, the letter "" X "" , sometimes a bluish color at the sides of the screen, some book pages, an orange sun, two horns of an animal which likens to dragon, and a mushroom of a nuclear bomb.  ı saw a hose. so many hose I saw a huge window engulf the screen, there was a sword slashing across the screen, there was a boat splashing through a lake across the screen. and I saw really colorful pillars moving from the Centre of the screen to the sides like the ""Link Start"" moment in sword art online, other than that there was some thunder bolt looking things going on around the screen.  I saw a light blue image resembling crumpled up paper I saw a line in the center of my screen, slowly rotating 360 °. Its color was black, but it was surrounded by curved or zigzagging lines of yellows and pinks. The appearance of extra colors also occurred with the images that I saw on the rest of the screen, which consisted of multiple squares and circles of uniform sizes, placed as if they were aligned bricks. At other times in the test, I observed larger-vague circles, taking up about 1/4 of my screen, moving and fading in the corners. In general, I could only see shapes with quite blurred edges, mostly black but with touches of other colors in the form of thin lines. I saw a long triangle shape with a circle underneath it. Then I would see a spinning ball of light in the center of the screen. I also saw lines zipping all around the screen. Flashes of multiple lines. They all seemed to be a somewhat glowing neon light. At first I thought I saw a dragon flying in the same neon outline but it went away fast. I listened to Metallica. I'll try white noise next time.  I saw a lot of faces & figures, & some weird lines and patterns mostly "

I saw various mosaic type of morphing shapes within these flashes of colors. At various times, I could see a visual image of whatever thoughts I was attending to in my mind such as work or future planning. I remember being about five minutes in and feeling my eyes being very tired and difficult to maintain focus.  It was about then that I started to attend to my thoughts more and noticed very clearly that I can hear a voice in my head speaking to me that is outside my thoughts.  My voice of intuition. By 10 minutes in my eyes were too tired to continue and I was relieved to be able to stop. I saw a lot of fractals, in movement like I was flying deeper or closer to an origin. With time I saw silhouettes of people or faces, comprised of geometric shapes, in motion, rotating like a 3D image. I saw a lot of garfield stuff. His head moving in weird diagonal patterns. I also saw spinning doors, a planet cleaning contraption, a shiny ball, two spaceships shooting lasers at eachother. Propaganda posters, along with the people form those photos standing. The personlooked like the monopoly guy but taller and fatter. I saw a lot of green blobs, also a lot of dark scratches and 'dust'. A few times I would see very brief shape or image that seemed familiar, but not lasting long enough to decipher it. I saw a lot of green but red stayed predominant.  I quit because it was going to give me a headache.  The green would look like seaweed strings very briefly. i saw a lot of yellow and purple shapes along with green landscapes. almost like a forest I saw a lot. It started with simple shapes, a checkerboard pattern. Those patterns were turning into sort of whips- But fluid all over the screen. They were coming towards me, and then moving away. There was orange light coming from the bottom left corner of my screen, very bright. The fluid motions of the whips turned into me flying through space with light at the end of the tunnel, I don't know how to describe it. Just movement through space. For a lot of the time, everything was spinning. After the whipping motions (That's the best way to describe) the images switched between going through space and spinning black hole-like things. The Earth was spinning too, the view was above it in space. There were lines on it, like rivers or lights of cities. That was where it ended once I closed the site. I saw a man come stumbling through a door at the end of a hall. There were pipes along the hall near the ceiling. The hall would warp and twist. If I concentrated on spiders I could see what looked like spiders with too many legs. The images were often bright neon pink and sky blue or sometimes purple. (I have astigmatism in my right eye which might explain why the images often appeared more on the right?) As I moved my eyes across the screen the image would follow or break into complex diamond patterns or cats-eye type patterns. Kind of like the Eye of Sauron. I saw a man running, can't remember much I saw a man's face with glasses for few seconds  I saw a open hole that I was in and moving to it and the hole had lighting lineer. then I saw myself as screaming out. I saw a path, also as the sea in skyline, a hallway too, but sound make me time in a rain and a car stuck in mod  I saw a Phoenix and birds I saw a Phoenix and birds I saw a pulsating red-black checkerboard pattern (with each square approx. 1 inch wide), which faded into pure flashing red towards the periphery of the screen. On top of that, I saw one or two fuzzy white points, about an inch across as well, in about the place where I expect my blind spots to be. I saw a rectangular pattern. It was clearest and with the finest detail towards the edge of the screen but was present throughout. The pattern disappeared when I moved my face closer to the screen. I saw a red and yellow dragon flying in the blue sky and under it there was a somewhat small waterfall, I also managed to see some vegetation and rocks. I saw a reddish color dot, it would move to left of screen. Then back to center & repeat.  I saw a rotating circular pattern, quite complex, consisting of lines, circles, and some moving lines. This moving pattern lasted for a while, then it changed to a horizon, with straight patterns coming towards the horizon. Then after a while I started seeing yellow and green colors, although faint, mixed in. The pattern started to look like lasers firing towards the center, where they combined into a stronger beam that fired directly upwards. At some point this changed into weird patterns the morphed out of the center of the screen, and I started seeing eyes, with weird cartoony faces that were stretched along with the pattern. Eventually I must admit that I got a bit distracted by other sounds in my environment, which made most patterns disappear, and I quickly became bored and stopped watching. I saw a series of various images constructed from my memory such as staircases, war scenes, basketball courts, cartoon characters, etc I saw a simple background of trees and water. I also saw orange and yellow.  I saw a small red light in the middle and later a grid of tiny blue lights everywhere. Also, sometimes the screen was almost completely black or red and I saw red or black ""blobs"" in geometric patterns.  I saw a snowflake in the beginning that reappeared a few times during the experience. Half a sun was rotating on top of the screen (its rays were not straight but zig-zag, a bit like it's represented on greek pottery), I saw a cartoonish face in the middle of the screen getting distorted (similar to Waluigi), I saw Paris at night with rooftops and the Eiffel Tower, I saw a column of legionnaires going to war. The screen was changing too, getting larger and bigger sometimes. And a lot of the time it looked like I was going through a twisting and turning tunnel at very high speed, a bit like in the beginning of Doctor Who. Every single image was black on a red font, except for a white ball that bounced on the sides of the screen (diagonnally) at very high speed (too fast for it to be enjoyable to watch). I saw a snowflake in the middle I saw a spider, I saw a building, I saw an igloo like structure, I saw a turtle, I saw lines and different colors emerge in the periphery. I saw a spinning top, a galaxy and a lot of swirling balls I saw a stairs and ı get closed to stairs then ı saw letters and sembol of elements in many cubes or keyboard then there was plus sembol on side of the screen ıts was shining but ı cant remember which colors was it then screen get more darker place like ı was in forest in the dark and there was some vision like trees and ı was looking for the moon shine or just to sky and after that it was some where roller coster or was railway but in a gray building then ı ended the experiment I saw a star, a pretzel, a skull, some kind of surface with engraving, and lots of triangles, almost forming a tunnel. I saw a sunset, a face, a gingerbread man  I saw a tunnel that I am getting in it and it was super fast, colorfull (white, red, black, orange) and has some shapes those are coming to me. I saw boxes and stars. I saw a tunnel, a sun rise and set across the screen, a tall structure appear as if I was lying on the ground, and an explosion that flattened everything around it. I saw a very heavily wooded forest it was fall there's a trail that led back towards a waterfall. At the waterfall there is a very nice pool at the bottom very Rocky sides you can see the mist coming from the water as it flowed. I saw a war scene about old times. They were fighting on horses with spears in their hands. I've seen too many people. It was like they were migrating. They were going up into the mountains. Some were riders, some were going on foot. It was like watching a fast 2D cartoon. i saw a wide range of simple imagery across the screen which changed every couple of minutes. I saw a wooden bridge over a water feature like you would see at a Japanese garden I saw a yellow light swirling in red fluid.  Sometimes the light would take the shape of a star or a cube.  It would radiate waves red and orange outward and swirl counter-clockwise then clockwise.   I saw a yellow sun up in the top, but when I focused on it the red became orange. I saw as if the screen started to rotate but it would make me dizzy so I would lose focus on that and then I would start seeing as if a black anti-light was being bounced from left to right. I then realised I could mend its speed. I saw a, mostly, deep blue “fog” behind which were dark lines that, at first, resembled text. Later the lines resembled some sort of grid likened to that of a city map.  I saw all the primary colours and white and black; i saw a face in profile which warped into a distant view of a planet, like jupiter. the flicker would appear to run diagonally across the screen from one corner, then another, then radiate outward from a circle in the centre. I saw an ""X"" that moved around, but stayed mostly in the center of the screen.  At the end of each bar of the ""X"" was a variation of clovers, grids, and half-circles.  At times, the half circles would line up across the lower middle of the screen from left to right.  The patterns seemed to get more defined as time went on. I saw an buttlerfly with rainbow wings, cars, spiders. I saw something like the interspace voyages from Star Wars.  I saw an eagle..more than two or three times. I saw a car driving in a zip zag pattern and someone's face I saw an infinity symbol right away, readjusted my focus then saw snakes and cresting waves, then readjusted screen position and saw nothing when my reflection was visible I saw an old growth spruce forest, with mountains in the background.  The perspective was on the edge of the forest, with the tree line to the right and the mountains straight ahead.  it appeared to be around mid May or just a tad bit later, depending on location.  The sky was a light blue with a few puffy white clouds.  The grass was a more spring green, with little length to the blades and the forest was thickly grown with little space between the trees.  It was a bit stylized, reminding me of a landscape painting. I saw an ornate piece of something, similar to a chess piece. I saw a tangle of something. I saw a rounded shape, perhaps an eye, that turned into a diamond shape. I saw black on the edges of the screen and orange in the middle. I saw diagonal criss-crossing lines that slowly sank. I saw the screen expanding some. I saw bubble things. I saw an outline of a church-type building that looked like it was outlined in blue and green neon I saw an X nearly the entire time, in the middle of the screen. it stayed constant and floated around even though the colors sometimes changed. it floated very smoothly, like something in water, a feather in the air. then it started looking like some sort of light-tentacle. it wasn't a detailed limb but it came down from the top of the screen and unraveled, then curled again. I only saw that one once. the X wasn't present when I saw this. I saw red, blue, black, green, started to get some teal. it seemed like a black fog was coming out of the screen and into the surrounding air. not detailed plumes like smoke, but sort of electrical I guess. when I rotated the screen the X didn't rotate with it. I saw an X shape forming, it was blue in the middle. I also remember seeing squares of different colors overlapping larger squares, I saw white cubes moving in a spiral-like manner. I saw at first lines moving in different directions, and an X pulsating in the middle and rotating, a sun or a ball of light in different places of the screen, a flying animal or a butterfly, a pair of eyes, like a wolf or a lion's eyes, I saw green and yellow,  I saw a wave turning into peaks, or these lines of heart pulse coordinated with the noise sound. I saw birds or baths, stars and a face of a man like Lawrence of Arabia kind of falling down in a medium closeup for a few time, each time I could see him clearer. In some point there was a little blue dots on the screen. The colors changed there directions a lot of times, circles, left right up down and also the paste/time changed like hearth beat from fast to slow. When I finished watching I turned on the light and suddenly I saw like fata morgana heat waves, transparent smoke and jellyfish rising up. It looked like I am in a transparent watery something.  I saw blue and white patterns similar to mandalas. Many circular shapes and waves I saw blue often, not black. I saw vertical and horizontal lines. Vertical went from top to bottom, I assumed from the eye focal point changing. Occasionally saw curved lighter colored images in center, no distinct pattern but whiter/silver in color.  I saw blues and greens and the silhouette of a forest I saw blur blue circles, very black thin stripes and a thunder. I saw bodies everywhere I saw bombs. bouncing bomb pictures but i have not seen in real life this pictures. a thousand bombs are bouncing in the screen like a gravity , and going somewhere idk. but its in the 6. or 7. minute . in 1-5 minute i saw only a (again i have not seen this door in real life) egypt door . big and always i saw 270° and returning to 0° . its returning and It's disappearing. and coming repeat after 30 seconds and making same return. and idk when, i saw human heads but only half (up). half heads acting very faster in the screen . oh sorry forget to say the most important think i saw. I don't know why but I don't remember seeing something like this. These sounds turned into Train Sounds and i saw a actin train track in the top on screen. the train went on for 20 seconds. I saw bubble words (like those written in cartoons or comics), the sky from the view point of looking up through a forest, explosions of light (like fireworks), swirls of light/patterns, peoples faces, the color blue and purple I saw buildings and the screen was constantly growing and the screen seemed to spin, I saw a spider web pattern. I saw butterfly formations in blue. I saw Captain America throwing his shield into the camera. Like the opening title sequence to many Marvel movies. I saw cartoon like hunting men, too many colors other than black and Red, and I saw dama pattern, but first i saw something scary a goats eye and a woman from hell they were Black and Red.  I saw castles. Cartoon-like faces. Roads. Somehow I saw fractals changing color in the entire screen or in a peripherical. I saw how my screen was gradually getting bigger; it felt like It got almost twice as bigger. Then I saw a weakly visual story, like a movie, but I couldn't understand anything more than ""it felt like a movie, it had story"". I saw circles, boxes, X like shapes, spinning boxes, different colours (but I'm colour blind) so they looked like different colours or shades. I saw city outlining though out my 3 minutes I saw colors like yellow and blue, lots of distortions.  There was lots of variations throughout and increased in abstraction the longer I watched.  i saw colours red, black and white. 
I saw different shapes going out of the corners of the scrren, then things moving from one side to the other. 
i saw a forest, a path.  I saw complex geometric patterns that mirrored each other. I also saw ripples, undulating brightness of color, and a ball bouncing around the screen, I saw cross-shaped tunnel, spiraling tunnel and also a house I saw different background colors at first, mostly green or purple. The flashing sped up and slowed down, at first I thought it was the video. I kind of zoned out and then started seeing faces. I saw different colored lights, a light tower, cop car lights, the moon, ravens, creatures that I can't really describe but that looked they were out of a horror movie. Shadows. Shapes. I saw different colours a lot - grey, blue, orange, and white. I saw the skyline of a city, it also felt like the screen was expanding and could take up my whole room. It also made me very sleepy  I saw different faces morphing into each other  I saw different shapes and patterns that were changing color and moving around  I saw different shapes like triangles, vertical lines and reticular patterns. They were black most of the time and sometimes white. The red color was always the background for the shapes. Sometimes the screen seemed expanding over the frame of the pc. Frequently looked like the screen had a certain deepness. In one occasion I saw like a shadow was crossing the screen behind the red color as it was a red curtain. I saw dinosaurs and dragons fighting in a forest I saw eyes both horizontal and vertical that move in and out of the screen i saw face like joker  I saw faces and shadows moving, I also saw many different colors and patterns. As I focused more, I started seeing thing in my mind and not on the screen, I stoped focusing on what I was trying to see in the screen and just on what I was experiencing. I saw faces, some landscapes that looked more like pencil drawing than pictures, I saw some unsettling things that I cannot put into words and I vividly saw what looked like hands coming out of a slit as though grasping onto the sides to pull themself out. I saw the colors green, yellow, gray, pink, and purple. At the spaces between some images it was as though I was seeing the sound waves of the white noise playing in my ears. Saw random shapes that morphed into the next image.  I saw first checkered patterns then it the colours shifted to red and blue. From these shifts, fractals started to appear and morph in and out of the screen. The focal point of these fractal patterns shifted around smoothly across the screen. I saw flashes of a grid pattern, with some greens and blues. I also saw some sky scrapers...tall buildings.  I saw flashes of Images that looked like pencil animation. A whirlpool that changed directions when I asked it to spin the other way, anime character doing material arts across the screen. Heart in the center pulsating. These images lasted anywhere from 2-5 seconds. Recurring images of rollercoasters, whirlpool and angels or fairies. The images appeared mostly in the center, but sometimes from one side of the screen to the other. I saw flashing turquoise shapes pointing towards the centre and spiralling around, they were fuzzy edged and fairly unchanging. Around the outside of the shapes (which were in a circle) were what looked like simple (like old cave drawings) black line drawings. They started out as cows. As they flashed they moved positions both around the circle and also the cows looked like they were moving, like stop motion. As I watched they changed into other kinds of animal. I saw giraffes. There were others but they changed too quickly to name them. They were moving like they were dancing around the centre of the screen like it was a fire. The centre of the screen was lighter than the rest. After a while bright purple/indigo spots appeared all over the screen. Then the line drawings became people. They were reaching towards each other in the centre of the circle and their limbs were all getting tangled up. I felt very strongly in my body a eurphoria and an agitation. I had the thought ""they are showing me we are not separate"". I wanted to stop because my eyes were hurting a lot so I turned it off at this point.  i saw flowers and other shapes to begin with, then i felt like i was moving down a hall which changed into falling off a skyscraper. I also saw a ferris wheel, and then two gears working together. I saw flowers when I close my eyes, lines, circle and the color green I saw for one second the windows bar I saw galaxies and star systems, then I warped through a wormhole and saw clouds in the sky. Then a large laser X was tilting back and forth with a circle looping and oscillating around the bottom right leg of the X. Then I saw clouds again and warped through another wormhole. Then I saw more clouds and a woman's face, up close. This morphed into a man sitting down sketching in a book. He quickly flipped the page and sketched another, and another. When he was done, he flipped through the pages as a flip-book and it showed an animated flightless bird I have never seen before that was running, opening and closing it's beak. This morphed back into clouds and then multiple lasers started rotating in both directions, leaving trails of rainbow colors. This morphed into the outline of a city and then into a flying dragon and back to clouds. The clouds were always different and moving. I noticed I would forget to blink and my periphery would become black until I blinked. Needing to remember to blink distracted me and I saw less vivid images, most of which are not really describable for the rest of the session. I saw galaxies, and scattered shapes. Think I saw a clear image of the milkyway (like in those photos) - saw a human with long hair that made me kind of scared. i saw geometric objects like lines and Turkey's map (country) I saw geometric shapes and patterns often swirling. Sine waves and zigzags. Occasionally they morphed into animals or faces.  i saw geometric shapes similar to what you see in DMT inspired artwork. think alex grey. lots of eyeballs and similar things. there was a serpent made of eyeballs that was a repeating figure. i saw a lot of symbols that looked like they would come from ancient humans artwork, like i mightve seen some in old native arts before. at one point one of the symbols was the black sun which i recognized.  I saw geometric shapes, mostly squares turned at a 45 degree angle, but sometimes five- or eight-sided.  The shapes generally looked like I was speeding into or out of a long tunnel, which curved in one direction.  Occasionally, the ""tunnel"" would suddenly stop and the whole image would spin on a vertical or horizontal axis so that I was looking at the ""tunnel"" from the side, then another shape would emerge.

On several occasions, I saw a more static geometric shape, like a pentagon with lines coming from the center out to each vertex, that would spin clockwise or counterclockwise, accelerating until the rotation blurred, and then the image would suddenly appear to be spinning in the opposite direction, slowing down until it stopped, then a new image would emerge.

On one instance, I saw what looked like a frog swimming down toward the bottom of the screen. I saw geometric squiggle shapes that undulated across screen; I also saw pulsating circle in center. or nose and eye ridges. Also saw iris & pupil of one eye. Everything was red as dominant color. Black as accent. And sometimes different  with each eye. Movement with left eye was geometric squiggles. Right eye only was pulsating circle.  I saw geometrical parterns such as kaleidoscope images, I saw different colours (pink, blue, red, black) I saw horizon skyline such as a sunset with shapes of people, landscape or city skyines which appeared black over a redish background. Also saw moving geometry patterns making me think of ripples on the water surface as if when a drop falls on a still water surface and ripples in circle i saw green and blue lights sometimes i saw a lights going different ways and came back together I saw green sparkles until I realized they were the afterimages of floaters and then I didn't see them anymore. When I kept my eyes in the center I the flicker seemed to come from the center with the screen divided into quadrants. The screen would appear to flicker from the direction of my last saccade for a couple seconds before reverting to the quadrants or just the flicker. As my eyes got color fatigued I saw some yellow and then some peach in the flicker. I saw green squares and little blue dots. I saw a lot of wave like images like crashing waves. The screen would sometimes turn yellow. It seemed like I could see my own eyes sometimes, looking back at me, or some kind of eye. There were occasional flashes of white. I didn't see any landscapes or full faces, though. I saw grey-blueish balls and warping tornado-ish shapes get out of the background. i could also twirl into the red as if it spinned continouesly if that makes sense.  I saw Grid lines all over the phone after a few minutes,  a dark ball close to the top of the screen, flickers seemed slower after a while and i could see each time it went from black to red before it went back to flashing.  Did this after a long day at work and started falling asleep so I cut it 3 minutes shy of 10 minutes. Might try again with dark room and white noise for research purposes if it would help. I saw human silhoettes and a teddy bear"
"1793, 1794, 1795, 1796, 1798, 1799, 1800, 1802, 1803, 1805, 1808, 1809, 1810, 1817, 1820, 1821, 1823, 1824, 1827, 1829, 1831, 1832, 1833, 1834, 1836, 1837, 1838, 1839, 1840, 1841, 1843, 1844, 1845, 1846, 1847, 1848, 1849, 1850, 1852, 1853, 1854, 1855, 1857, 1858, 1859, 1860, 1861, 1863, 1864, 1867, 1868, 1869, 1870, 1871, 1874, 1879, 1880, 1882, 1884, 1885, 1886, 1887, 1889, 1890, 1891, 1892, 1894, 1896, 1897, 1898, 1906, 1907, 1912, 1914, 1916, 1917, 1919, 1920, 1921, 1923, 1924, 1925, 1926, 1927, 1929, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1945, 1946",8,"I saw images whenever I closed my eyes.  They were very green circles with little white circles on their edges. They started early in the experience and recurred each time I closed my eyes.  I opened my eyes quickly so I didn't test persistance. I saw in the beginning as if a kind of blurred grid was formed with the intermitence, some spreaded thin artifacts which were probably my floaters, and color green in the beginning and blue later on instead of black (to be expected as complementary to red) I saw it as if it were a train and later a rocket, as if it were literally a train with many details, in some parts I accelerated the speed (The speed was related to the rhythm of the music) . At other times I saw spirals and vortexes forming and consuming the entire screen like a tornado.  I saw jellyfishes, eyes, octopuses or similar i saw kanye west at some point i am sure about that i felt like my computer is moving and i felt like i have control over colors and shapes  I saw lightening, and a river and dendritic images I saw lightning, storms, cogs turning in a clock, a dragon chasing and biting something, etc i saw Lines , black Lines I saw lines and patterns that crisscrossed across the screen in a pattern that looked similar to plaid in clothing. I saw lines of different width, grids, fractals, repeating 3d objects like 3d fractals, tunnels.
If I thought about something it appeared on the screen, it happened with a tall building or spaceship, something like that.
I saw colors other than red and black, mostly in the edges, in a moment i thought ""i haven't seen green"" and it appeared in a few second, same with purple.
I felt a vivid sensation of speed while seeing tunnels. I saw lines that almost looked like galaxies. after 5 min the whole screen suddenly looked like it was covered in static like an old movies film. The red colour also appeared to change to a darker shade. This remained until the end with shapes coming and going in the background. I saw lines that converge on the top of a man, they were green, lilac, orange and the center was a light red band, these lines snaked until they made the man's torso go out of the screen. Then I change to the image of a person on his back with a basket of fish, then they were lines again, those same lines ended up being part of a face, right eye, nose and part of the chin. This part of the face fell apart and formed a house with a giant blob.

Yo vi líneas que convergen en la parte de arriba de un hombre, eran de color verde, lila, naranja y el centro era una banda de color rojo claro, estás líneas serpenteaban hasta hacer que el torso del hombre saliera de la pantalla. Luego cambio a la imagen de una persona de espaldas con un cesto de pescados, después fueron líneas de nuevo, esas mismas líneas terminaron formado parte de un rostro, ojo derecho, nariz y parte de la barbilla. Esta parte del rostro se deshizo y formó una casa con gorma gota gigante. i saw lines that fluctuate to the rhythm of the sound and small balls of the same color at the same time that spinning like a galaxy model. ı saw little globes on screan while lights were blinking I saw lots of circles or orbs and lines moving like in the movie Fantasia near the beginning. These orbs and lines were the most frequent things I saw. I felt like I was at the ocean at times due to the white noise, floating birds-eye-view along a coast. I could see myself but not my face and while in the past I’ve had long hair and a beard I cut it and shaved last week. It felt like I could see my hair even longer than before and my beard as well much much longer. I saw a woman’s bare right shoulder facing me and part of the neck and side of the breast all in red and lined in black. I saw intestines normal and abnormal in red and lined in black. I think I felt palm trees as well as glowing orbs not very large that could be like electric coconuts. I also saw an electric line that lingered for a good while never perfectly straight but always horizontal with crests and troughs that would float stop motion like as it waved. That’s about it.  I saw lots of colour blue, it all merged like a marble/cloudy effect of reds and blues I saw lots of tiled geometric shapes almost right away. But after a bit of time, I started to see scenes that looked like old Disney cell animation (like Mickey Mouse steering a steam boat). These animated scenes didn't have any colours. Once I saw a colourful rotating temple or idol but that didn't last too long. i saw lots of zig zags and then they morphed into a geometric kind of a web. I saw many bright indistinguishable “colors”. There were clear moving and morphing shapes. The rapid inconsistency of the oscillating red and black started to give me a headache so I stopped.  My vision felt indistinguishably different for a few minutes after the experience. I saw many crosses and geometric patterns I saw many different objects that began to move more and more quickly once they began to move very fast the entire image engulfed my field of vision, almost as if I was closing my eyes and seeing it in my minds eye.  I saw many faces ome after the other. An old women, a man, a young lady. A lady was holding an axe and a man was running. I also saw a scorpio.  I saw many geometric shapes and then I was constantly racing though a black and red striped tunnel that was going everywhere like a roller coaster. It was fun, but made me really dizzy so I stopped. i saw many things, and the experience was like watching a movie. there were faces, people, cartoons, places...
in one moment I saw people playing football, and sometimes it became in a more realistic texture and other times it went in a more cartoon texture. the ball was moving as people hit it, and I could see the green of the floor and the blue of the sky
i also saw faces and people dancing in a forest
besides, i saw Donald from mickey mouse, and I could see it shouting and moving like if I was watching mickey mouse in real life, all was colourful
(sorry for my English, it's not my first language, so i tried to describe it as better i could) I saw morphing, rolling, and spinning shapes not unlike a kaleidoscope (but only in black and red). Initial images were somewhat like a fanned out grid with a few long-spiked eight-point stars in various locations where grid lines connected. Several minutes into the Ganzflicker, and with harder concentration, the images on the screen began to spin or alternatively roll inward on themselves in the shape of the golden ratio. The images both moved of their own volition AND were moved along by my eyes trying to track them across the screen, which made it difficult to focus. Eventually the moving images led me to the edge of the screen and broke my concentration further. Other times when my eyes became unfocused, yet trained at the center of the screen, I thought I saw a rough outline of a neighborhood of rooftops. At a much later point, I could imagine myself spiraling through space along the edge of earth's atmosphere and towards the sun. This was by no means a clear picture though, because I feel like it was partially in my blind-ish mind's eye/imagination rather than on the screen, though I was definitely seeing some of the major shapes on the screen that then informed the imagining (It is very difficult to explain my mind's eye because I feel that it is 'neither here nor there'; I know it exists, yet I can't fully 'see' what I 'visualize' in my mind [yet I am an architect/design professional who successfully relies on my ability to conceptualize rooms and buildings in my mind before committing them to paper]. So the best was I can explain this is to say that I 'feel' things like shapes and ideas in my mind, in leiu of an active visual mind or constant stream of consiousness.).  I saw mostly beams of light shooting all over the place. Eventually I thought I saw what looked like scribbles flash in my periphery (kind of like a small child's attempts at drawing). Towards the end the bands of light became bands of rainbows and they began to write all over the screen. Towards the end it sort of felt like I was flying between buildings, the perimeters of which were defined by the rainbows. Weird. I feel like if I kept going the sense would have solidified. Maybe I'll try again soon :) I saw mostly geometric shapes and continuous flickering from completely red to completely black. I saw mostly geometric shapes, but intermittently I saw staircases, blue stars (like I'm going through space at warp speed), and once or twice a lake. I saw mostly geometric shapes. Circles that expanded outward. Squares that moved robotically. Triangles and hexagons. Everything looked alive.  I saw mostly red and black, but also navy blue, sky blue, bright yellow and orange travelling through the screen,  moving in geometric shapes. I also saw the screen expanding and growing smaller as if it was breathing, and at one point it looked like there was a gate made of glowing embers with lava at the other side, but all in colours, not defined shapes. Blue lines and small circles appeared on top of my monitor. I saw mostly sea. Waterfall or being on a ship, felling the hard wind on my face. I saw moving patterns in an elliptical movement.  I saw multiple faces and shapes. constantly morphing into each each other. They seemed to be interacting in some way. I also saw colors in shades of greys, dark blues and dark oranges I saw multiple gears turned from one side to the other, green rays of light, buildings goping up and donw, power cables that took me from one point to another, I saw spaceships cities, at one point I saw an eye in the center of the screen that was looking at me and pulsating, too I remember a couple of circular saws on each side of the screen turning. sometimes the color would spin around the edges, this being a more intense red, yellow or orange. Sometimes I controlled the flow of the images, other times the images moved me, I felt tense all the time and a little dizzy I saw my face and splotches and maybe some blue  i saw my screen flipping up and down as fast as possible, and then I saw it zoom out and it looked like i was watching it in a theatre I saw natural outdoor environments. Mountains and seascapes.  I saw Navy Blue, and I also saw shapes and stuff. I saw objects that reminded me of camera lenses, feathers, and road maps. I saw occasional bars of orange and pink, both vertical and horizontal and mostly centered in the screen or slightly above center. There was also the sensation that the center of the screen was spinning. It looked a bit like a stylized flower or a propeller. When I blinked the screen would briefly appear totally red and still. I did not last the whole 10 minutes because my eyes started to feel strained. i saw one image in the left hand side; a strip right down the screen. about 1/5 of screen like a photo. of a woman in a blue suit. leaving a door. lasted 1-2 seconds. i also saw images. light sources, as if through blinds, movements like small birds 'in the air' outside the screen. I saw only the flashing. There may have been a few tiny shapes at first but they went away I saw people waiting in a loose group, children holding their mothers' hands, like in a lobby or train station waiting area. I saw flowers and geometric shapes morphing and some random dots making geometric morphing shapes. I saw Jupiter, then Greek statuary. That gave way to a series of fly by faces, like I was approaching people from a smaller angle, swooping by their faces. Some were like drawings, others were real faces but not if anyone I know or seen before. Predominant colors were red, green, blue, white. The flashing made it visible like an old movie reel, only like if I were in a room with a strobe light. I saw perfect patterns over the whole screen i saw flowers blooming and buildings .it also felt like i was moving foward at a fast speed with different colors I saw pink and green chrysanthemums. I saw pink hearts, a giant letter G, a white machine gun, a forrest and giant wheels turning I saw pinwheels all over the screen. I saw a tunnel in the center of the screen. I saw pulsating geometrical shapes and objects in constant motion across the screen. I saw spiral galaxies which would appear briefly and move across the screen. I saw snake-like objects writhe across the screen. The coolest thing I saw was the coalescence of multiple shapes which formed an MC Escher like scene in motion. Perceived shapes and objects did not last in a static form for long at all - things were constantly moving and melting into each other.    I saw pulsing geometric shapes, patterns, and waves. They were constantly moving. Mostly in red/gray/black, but a couple of times I saw green or blue as well. The pulsing patterns would be stable (not static, but pulsing regularly) for 5 - 10 seconds before morphing into something else. I wanted to pull the screen as close to my face as possible to try to enhance the effect. On a couple of occasions the visuals felt like ""going through hyperspace"", i.e. the patterns were pulsing in a way reminiscent of the hyperspace special effect found in movies like Star Wars. The patterns seemed to pause momentarily when I would blink, so I tried to avoid doing so. I saw rainbows spinning like fans and after a while I started to see lines like the one in the middle of the road, it was moving though I saw random sawtoothed patterns all over the screen, swirling and morphing constantly, and occasionally large, blurry dark green blotches would fade in and out. By the end of the ten minutes, these had never become any more coherent or complex. I saw rapidly shifting fractals shooting across the screen in, as if they were moving in 3D. They formed shapes and interacted with each other, and exploded and revolved in strange ways. I also saw vague impressions of nameable objects (eg cars, trees) but it felt more like I was seeing an abstract image that my brain was interpreting as an object for a moment rather than actually seeing it. I saw rectangular corridors and it looked like I was moving through them. The corridors were like geometric boxes. I also *think* I saw some strange vantage points like I was looking down at an architect's drawing desk with a t square and crumpled paper all over the place. The image was like an outline that was done one over the other with different colored lines. It's kind of like a video technique or photoshop choice. Hopefully, you know what I'm trying to describe! (I'm not an architect, btw) I saw red and black colours continuously. I saw repeating patterns of small, round, red orbs of light pulsating in rows that radiated out from the center of the screen, extending all the way to the edges.  The pattern slowly rotated about the center point of the screen in one direction.  After several seconds it slowed down and rotated in the opposite direction.  This change in rotational direction occurred every several seconds.  I also occasionally saw a roughly circular ring of light in the center of the screen with jagged edges that vibrated rapidly. I saw round objects like a tire, a face, buildings, coins, trees I saw rows of shelves when my phone was further away, but up close is saw a bright dot in the middle of the screen. Also if I tilted my phone the shelves also tilted as well.  I saw several images:
two rotating balls connected by a shaft
rainbow lines, and once an actual rainbow shaped rainbow
a grassy horizon
geometric lines across the screen I saw several simple shapes: A bar ""bouncing"" horizontally or veritically back and forth, a circle or line spinning around the center of the screen. I started to see a more complex shape (a tire rope swing swinging back and forth) shortly before I had to stop due to becoming anxious. I saw several sweeping laser beams and different arrangements of flashing lights, some with round edges and others with many rays emitting from them. I also saw the same image at several points that would stay on the screen and morph with the next scene, but it was like one of the frisbee-like discs with a hole in the center or a hula hoop or something, flat and round like planetary rings. It was rainbow and spinning on different angles, appearing, disappearing, and reappearing at a different angle. It was a spinning rainbow laser-ring, basically. Sometimes it would tilt left, sometimes it would tilt right, sometimes it would grow or shrink as if approaching or departing, and then it would morph back into the arrangements of flashing lights.  I saw several things. Nothing much at the beginning but I could see pyramids, conical shapes, and weird patterns just flashing in and out of existence. The beginning reminded me a lot of those rendering tests they do for graphics card. Once it had gone on for a while, maybe a couple minutes in, I would get flickers of very vivid imagery. Their were some weird creature every now and then(never human faces). The first of the more vivid images were of water flowing towards me with small waves(a calm water like a lake), sometimes there were ripple patterns rapidly moving around. One of the images felt like I was crossing a lake in the fog with mist flying by me on both sides. The most consistent images were of caves or tunnels. It seemed I was going through them on a train or rail car. It went very fast and there were many twists and turns, even hills. I remember seeing railing or track extremely vividly as if it was moving under me. I could see the gravel(individual rock), the wood(sometimes splintered), sometimes bracing around the walls. One image in particular looked like a hangar in a dome shape with a square pattern moving up the walls. Sometimes the tunnel split down the middle going two separate ways, this particular image was the only one I didn't feel I was moving in. I could see down both tunnel, but my reference point seemed to stay directly in front of the split. A lot of it looked like a metro tunnel (I've never been in one but it felt as if I was going through one). Sometimes these tunnels would spin, it reminded me of looking inside a jet turbine, but the image would contort and become nothing. I did see some palm trees near the end but never for very long. The experience starting soft, rose to a peak and came down near the end of the ten minutes. I saw shadow like people, the interior of a car, eyes, lots of em, and a brief flash of a vivid door. I saw shapes and structures, a weird solenoid ship flying through geometric dimension it was as if I was looking through broken glass with a microscope shapes were forming I saw a snake constantly going around and taking all the shapes and becoming the shapes and then turning into a giant Galaxy it was weird.. I saw shapes like snowflakes, broken glass, vortex or hurricane in the center, converging lines like rivers to the center, repetitive shapes like a chinese checker board, and I saw all the colors of the rainbow.  Sometimes it was like I was in a video racing game, going towards the finish line with everything flashing by. I saw shapes like stars, lines, rectangles; sometimes the flickering colors were blue or pink. The lines were oblique, never perfectly vertical or horizontal, and they seemed little sticks. I saw shapes like triangles, square and star I saw shapes stuck in a room and the room was closing on them, the shapes were bouncy and they rather looked like creatures that wanted out of the room so they just hit their head to the walls repeatedly as the walls were hitting them back. The shapes usually had white and blue in them as well, and went aroudn the room leaving a mark behind. I knew the shapes were going further each time because each mark was behind the previous one. At some point i saw a blue creature whose eyes were black and were covered with some weird yellowish line on the outside. It was looking at somewhere else carefully, didn't even mind my existence. But the shapes knew I was there. And they wanted my help. They knew I watched them suffer in that room. They knew that I was aware the room was going to crash them at this rate and the room didn't like them. I saw shapes then the middle started spinning I saw shapes, lines, and images almost constantly. They would become more vivid the longer I didn't blink, but sometimes they would return immediately, other times they would need a few seconds. It was also interesting viewing with one eye at a time, I didn't do this for very long, but each time I say patterns more and a couple weak, outlined shapes. But with both eyes I saw a huge variety. Mostly shapes of animals (larger animals like bulls or large cat animals, a few times a snake, especially a giant head of one), a humanoid lion the looked like it was roaring, dragons where often seen, sometimes just the head other times with their necks and only a couple times with their whole bodies. Sometimes I would see humans. Sometimes clouds or a field or branches. The scenery was never strong until the end. But what I found most interesting was the style of the visions. Most were only outlines, white, blue, black, and electric purple (literally looked like little bolts of purple electricity that formed the outlines) were the most common, and the red was the base color of the image. But sometimes it was very simple, other times very well defined and like a style of anime art, it looked hand drawn, but very well drawn. The level of detail and shading effects would sometimes be very well defined and appear to be appropriately colored, but only for a brief second before changing again. Some of the coolest were when the outlines of the images were in rainbow, almost holographic looking. This only happened two different times, maybe lasting for 30 seconds to a minute each. It was hard to tell how much time passed. But the shapes and images kept changing with the rainbow outline too. And the fill color was almost rainbow, but more dull than the outline. It's hard to describe how the art changed throughout, but at the very end, it flickered between vivid real life like images, like not seeing the red and black at all, except for faintly in the periphery, and in the majority of the center of my vision I saw a hospital, looked like the hallway with some doctors and nurses walking down it, and I could see a patient being carted into or out of a room, then it changed to a man in a blue outfit and hat, the had climbed a short ladder to a porch, I guess, to drop off a six pack of glass milk bottles like what used to be done, what, before the 80s? And there was a third rea life scene that I can't remember now. But these felt almost more like I was starting to dream with my eyes open. They stopped suddenly because the white noise stopped. It felt like five minutes had passed at the most, so I kept watching for a couple minutes in case the player stopped early and tried to get the super vivid images to come back. Didn't have any luck, but I only waited for another two minutes roughly, and this didn't have any of the loud white noise, just a fan in the background. I also thought it might be good to note that I put my laptop into tablet mode for this so I could have it right in my face and fill my field of view. But I also tried pulling it back about 20 inches, so it still filled most of my vision, but not entirely. This did create different effects, somewhat. And after a while, my vision felt pulled into the screen and it seemed to fill my entire field of view again. And the whole screen sometimes felt like it was jumping side to side rapidly, and somewhat up and down. When that started, I brought it closer to my face again and it stopped. But it was very interesting and cool, I thought I should describe the man a little more, e was grinning with short brown hair, looked to be in a suit, and he kind of pointed in one direction. And later it was either him or another man that threw a baseball of something, and when that happened the image became the ball as it grew closer from being thrown to my face, and then morphed into something else. Also saw what I would describe as a shaman, with a  cow head skull with horns on his head, a poncho, and a staff. He appeared more than once in different orientations. That's about all I can remember and differentiate from the more random shapes, blurs, and flashes. I saw short sharp scattered lines in cream or yellow, crinkled texture like paper, but mostly a swirling motion. Aside from the swirling, the images were faint and minor I saw some faces. I saw patterns come and go. I saw what looked like pulsing blood vessels. I saw some geometrical patterns/webs. they looked kind of greenish or white-ish, they were small, maybe the size of my thumbnail, and there were several of them, in a somewhat repeating pattern, like a wall paper. But the lines were faint and thin, a single one would last for a few seconds, and then they shifted a bit and I could see them again. my eyes hurt a bit as I lost sense of depth and focusing on the screen became hard. I only watched it for about 2 or 3 minutes before I had to stop I saw some triangles, maybe some circles, a creepy joker type smile, but really jagged, what looked like planets with accretion disks or black holes maybe, not completely sure. I saw someone dark with a cape, like a dark guardian or something, pretty scary... I saw something like a spider web and a spider in it. I couldn't see a clear face, although I could see a few silhouettes. I saw a light source like the sun and some rays coming from it. The rays were wavy. I would also like to point out that I only saw these images in black. It could be because I didn't do it long enough or because I wasn't in a appropriate room. I saw something that seemed to be a light spectrum, but it was really blurry. I also saw patterns (a very weak image) and sometimes I thought that I was seeing a little of blue and maybe pink or orange. 
I can get more vivid images by closing my eyes. I saw spinning circles of dots of brightness behind the screen, I had to unfocus my eyes to seen them clearly, that would start spinning in a small circle and speed up and the diameter would increase as they spun and then some dots would shoot out and escape the circle snd then sometimes the dots would become a line shooting out of the circle, but not a solid line, still fluid. If I moved my eyes or tried to refocus them on the screen itself they'd either disappear or restart. Sometimes the circle would turn into a planet (daydreaming/dreaming logic told me it was a planet? But it wasn't very detailed) and then it was bisected by another line and the circles started spinning again. Sometimes I saw two slow moving yellow/blue blurry blobs moving towards each other towards the center. They were about 10 o clock and 4 o clock and started at the same distance away from the center and were the same size and they'd always disappear before they joined together I saw spinning fractal geometry after a while, but at first it was as if I were traveling through space with celestial objects whizzing past me. Then my mind's eye ran wild--there was an archer, and wild animals, and a staircase being built from the top down. I saw spinning fractals and patterns that changed to blue spinning snowflakes and circular saw patterns. I randomly saw horses of different colors running through the screen. At first they were indistinct, then became more vivid.  I saw splatters of some colors other than red or black, like if they were painted in a canvas. Mostly blueish. Some yellow too. Some shapes where static, others moved. After these initial splatters, I started seeing something resembling fractals. I saw spooky/skeletal faces, eyes, dragons, bats, blobs, feminine and masculine faces, somebody licking my computer screen I saw star fields and zoomed forward, I saw circle patterns that swirled and swirled like an optical illusion. Lines and zigzags would weave all over the screen. I saw star systems and nebulas and travelling through space and seeing stars fly past. Forests at different angles, bird eye view looking down at a forest and another looking up at the stars through a forest canopy. I saw cityscapes and skylines. I saw geometric shapes too and a face but there was no detail of the face just an outline. I saw stars and geometric patterns and what seem to be spires I saw stars, nebulas and galaxies but i didnt experienced it all the time. Approximately i saw and felt space 4th to 8th minutes. And except this period a few times i saw only dark blue colour in the screen. But they were so short. I mean they happened only 10 seconds. I saw static like when the tv has no signal, Psychedelic colors in circular sunburst, an eye rotating around the screen.  I saw streaks of colors that were the visible light spectrum that would shoot up and down the screen, balls being thrown across the screen and possibly a face, white glow around the edges of the screen. I saw sun, forest, mechanical objects,  I saw swirling galaxies. At one ppint it was as if i could see it in vivid colors other than red. I saw yellow and blue hues. I saw swirls black circles pulsating and moving around a little bit but that was about it. Nothing else I saw was real significant I saw symmetric geometric figures all the time, I also saw one face like a clown, one hand and animals (a dos, a tiger, snakes and a crab) I saw text in the background when my mind was unfocused - but as soon as I focused on it it would disappear. At first it looked like complex mathematical equations then it just looked like text - also my iPhone screen began to heave and expand with each pulse    I saw the aforementioned spruce tree which then became a two-color circular tie-dye pattern, which then changed to pointed teeth going across the screen. At this point my eyes started to hurt so I turned it off.  I saw the bottom portion of a corona arc, as though the sun was located above the screen and I could see the bottom of the arc--maybe 20 degrees. It was composed of light lines emanating out from the center (so down on my screen). I also saw dark blobs take shape like you see in clouds. And I saw light-colored orbs. I saw the color variation between the red and black as an undulating form. The darker spots would undulate like the surface of a body of water (but faster), and occasionally take the form of rough simple objects (lines, waves, patterns you see on psychedelic tapestries). Occasionally it seemed like a face or something more would come into focus, but never did. The darker tone struck me more as a very dark yet washed out blue. I saw the colours keep changing from intensity with one another.  One moment it would be red red and a darker colour with explosions intermittently.    I saw the exterior wall of a castle, white hexagons, a spinning red image like a fan or pinwheel, faces and arms bashing themselves onto a table or something flat, paper dolls scrolling across the screen, silhouettes of Alfred Hitchcock scrolling across the screen going faster and faster, faint thin black lines like water color fanning out toward the top of the screen where they were almost black, an image of Deadpool like that of a closeup in a comic strip cutting off the top and bottom edges of his face, a terrifying face laughing at which point I felt extremely scared and unsafe, bold black lines static across the screen and also moving rapidly across the screen at different points, young girls playing on a merry-go-round, images of men standing around in a circle looking at the center of the screen, people playing cards around a table. It was all very rapid, and my emotions ranged from very calm to very unsafe. I saw the flashes pulse and strings of geometric lines constantly forming and deforming I saw the noise I saw the numbers 3, 5, and 6 in black. I also saw a T on its side and a bright blue circle."

Some of the water morphed into a sailboat. The sailboat then began to move across the water.  I saw the screen flickering white, red, and black. Close to 10 minutes I saw zig zag lines at the top of the scree, almost looked like chevron pattern or when the satellite goes out on the tv I saw the screen turn blue, and it seemed to be an ocean, shimmering... I saw the screen turn pink... all around the edges it was scalloped, like a continuous stone design, like I was looking out a scalloped edge window.... at times I saw a figure, silhouetted, standing and turning as though in front of a window, three times I saw the figure I think.... then the ocean again, but this time through a round opening like a portal... and yellow... yellow and blue. Once I saw a boat, an old fashioned sailing boat but indistinct like it was made of clouds. I saw the shape of a man coming out toward me from the center of the screen with a forceful motion with his hand I saw the shapes of the figures, like filmed skyscrapers from a drone, an attraction like a Ferris wheel, but horizontal I saw the sun reflection. It was a clear day, but I couldn't look at the sky, I only saw a reflection. Before, color explosions and transitions in different rhythms I saw the that I was watching the road inside the car and trees, the road, etc. were getting further from me. There was a house and I was walking through he door and when I touch the door handle it disappeared.    I saw the travel through space, my view obstructed by the red flashing but behind that I could see stars that were slowly turing. The scene kept shifting sometimes to shapes and colors, sometimes to cartoonish faces of people and figures. They were standing on a road and lokoing to me through my screen (again the red flicker was obstructing the view). Then I saw movements and the scene accelerated and moved back to the stars I saw the visual distortions first before the complex objects and environments and then the even more vivid and complex as well as seemingly sentient and attempting to communicate a message of some kind to me imagery I described above in the 'other' category emerged. I was captivated, however, unfortunately I had to finish early because I experience extreme migraines and the intensity of the imagery shifting was starting to feel like a migraine  'aura' or as if the it was causing painful eye strain that could trigger a migraine for me.   I saw threads in blue and pink. It can also be called a line. These lines were side by side. They were spinning fast together. They usually circled or followed a path similar to an infinity sign or the letter S. Sometimes they would come out from under the phone like a plant blooming. I saw three dimensional discs which resembled 'galaxies' spinning in various directions with beams of light coming out. I saw three distinct images;  Two wide black horizontal lines at top and bottom and multiple (3+) thinner black horizontal lines oscillating in the middle.  But if I concentrated on the very center of the screen, then 20 or so thin black vertical lines oscillated/flashed with the horizontal lines becoming dimmer but not disappearing.  If I concentrated on the righthand side of the screen, then I saw a long hallway, like you'd walk down in a school with huge windows along the lefthand side, and brilliant sunlight streaming in onto a super shiny waxed floor, windows into classrooms along the righthand side and a big window at the end of the hallway.  The hallway was probably 10 ft across and 60 feet long.  That image would disappear if I looked back toward the center but would reappear if I looked right back. I saw trains driving on the road coming out of tunnels, and the road had loops that they would drive on and go upside down--and the road was in a city; I saw patterns of boxes/checkered patterns I saw trees, a castle, and a helmet with wings I saw triangles, it looked like the vault of glass, then it went to space, black holes eating stars, and quasars spinning and pulsing, spinning disks. It also looked like I was racing or going very fast and the tack was moving, I could see different perspectives if I looked at the top bottom or center of the screen.  I saw tunnels as I ran down them; spinning ferris wheels with red white and blue lights moving across the screen; simple shapes such as circles and squares flashing and moving; more complex shapes like spiderwebs, funnels, and complex line patterns dancing and spinning and turning around on the screen. I saw tunnels that I travelled down as they twisted and turned. I saw vortex shapes like spinning hurricanes. I saw geometric spinning shapes such as hexagons. I saw shifting chequer board shapes. Later toward the end I started to see something stranger. It's like the computer screen ( outside of the screen ) had fuzzy snow like noise that streamed outward. You know like when you are viewing a 3d tv imagine? It's difficult to explain. I saw two distinct images. First, it was like I was watching a chrome hubcap rotating along with a car tire. That lasted a few seconds. Later I saw a line of can-can dancers, with frilled black dresses, thin white waists, and their arms were above their heads, crossed at the wrists. I saw two ribbons interlocking and flowing upwards into a double helix. My mind wandered and I was picturing the space around myself, and the darkened room. Then I closed my eyes and saw incredibly vivid diffraction patterns. I saw various images in the center of the screen and at times all over the screen. I saw waves, a box come out and recede, it looked like a swastika at one point, blue and green bars. I saw webs of colour yellow like vegetation and green spot patterns I saw what looked like etchings of light, and blue dots, moving all around the page I saw what looked like oblique linear bars at right angles to one another towards the lower half of the screen up to the centre. I saw what resembled the shape of an eye/iris in the center of the screen, as well as lines radiating outward from the eye, like rays of sun. I saw white diagonal lines flashing in the center of my vision, almost forming a V shape. I saw Xs seemed to be made up of the beam of light, persisted for a few seconds then began to change colours, started from light red, to white, to light yellow. The middle part of the X looked pretty lighter than the periphery, which looked maroon to black. The Xs were occluded by an infinity sign which exhibited similar colouring pattern with the Xs and increased in size as for a few seconds then went back to the initial size, then repeated. I also saw waves of a beam of light moving from the left of the screen to the right(from my right to the left), these waves demonstrated similar colouring patterns as the aforementioned figures. I saw yellow bars around the edges. I also saw shapes moving and shifting, although I could never quite make out what they were. I saw yellow lines zig-zagging across the screen. Couple of dark circles. At certain points of time I felt the flickering between red and black was like somebody had zoomed in on a bouncing out-of-focus basketball and I could sort of see the curvature of the ball as the screen turned red. At other points in time I felt the flickering is like when two trains pass next to each other and I'm in one of them in the window seat.  I saw yellow, then purple, throughout, kind of speckled through (could be afterimages from the red). Maybe 2/3 of the way through the screen started to get larger and then shrink back and forth. Sometimes the movements seemed to take on a whirlpool shape. I was in a room with no lights on, but daylight filled the room. I say a funny face, I saw many wheels, I saw a laser point that roam on the screen, I saw lady bird. I saw many other colors I see blue colour and green sometimes i see lines and a shape just like inside of a tube I see lines, geometric shapes and shining point. Blue, yellow and orange sometimes green. I see the Pink colour. İt is every where and ı don't care. There is not pattern or design.  I seemed to have some control.  For example, I could start things turning clockwise, or counter-clockwise. I seen a eye ball like it was soulless, a white dot appeared in the center of the retina, in the white noise i heard faint music and voices. It seemed like i dozed off and woke in seconds and seen a list like you'd see on Microsoft but gone to quick before i could read it, seen a building towards the right of screen. What got me is the voices and the music i heard in the white noise  I seen way too many things. The white noise enhanced alot to the point of like seeing in a movie when someone's life is flashing before their eyes just before they pass away. That's almost exactly how it was for me. Not only did I see images of different things such as the heartbeat lines moving across the screen, a pulsating heart shape, the swirrles as if I had dipped my finger in water to create that pattern but it was meant to stand for the Ripple Effect but I also seen images of suddenly my childhood flashing on the screen I could see two people coming together as if they were putting their forheads together and fixing to kiss. I also seen different slash marksas if with my fingersI had scratched the screen on the left and right sides that would flash through the entire experience. This experiment in a sense made me berry emotional perhaps because maybe I was already kind of sad prior to the experiment I'm not real sure but it definitely made me emotional. All in all this was an amazing experience but it did create the feeling as well as images to go along with it as if I had watched my entire life flash before my eyes. Each heartheartbeat line that had beat across the screen began from the bottom left corner and only showed about two top beats then would go away and then flash across the screenagain in the center and then on the right of the screen the Ripple effect images stayed on the bottom cemter to the bottom right corner, the heart shape that pulsated would flash from the center to the right of the screen but turned slightly to the left as if it were angled I shifted locations multiple times, one was a forest floor looking up seeing rain falling, another was in a checker board kind of room that spiraled into infinity. I saw three human figures holding hand dancing in a circle. I also saw lines that moved across the screen that reminded me of a physical representation of the internet, or the book case scene from Interstellar.  I stared at the center the whole time as best possible. I saw very vague starburst like shapes appear from center alternating from yellowing orange to blacky-red. Very much similar to the after image (solarised shimmery blobs) you get staring at something bright then dark e.g. a light bulb filament. On very few occasions I saw very vague lines or patterns in these colours that seemed to be more related to moving my eyes and refocusing around my screen. I definitely saw more deeper visuals when my eyes got heavy and I realised they were closing and I was more 'daydreaming' than seeing actual visuals. If I had to guess, I would say that because this would only trigger red cones while the red screen displayed (red saturation), and the other rods/cones activated either by the visuals created by the red cones after images or by desaturating the visual field of red (dim spectrum of all colours). It is probably just an optical illusion created by triggering different rods/cones in the eyes at different rates.  i started off in a house with a bunch of mayhem. 
carts are scratching the couch while dogs are barking. lamps getting knocked over.
yellow walls. chandeliers going back and forth. then the blades and saws stuff. 
an X that rotated when my head rotated. 
 I started off just seeing lines forming where my eyes were focused, forming crosses and starts that morphed between each other with the flickers. The space in the middle sometimes looked like an eye, sometimes like a person's face, sometimes like a smiling mouth. I also began to see flashes of bright neon yellow-green forming lightning bolts. At one point I moved a tiny bit and the change in the angle of the screen struck my eyes immediately and formed what looked like a forest or a city on a hill. The more complex images didn't look as detailed as in my imagination typically, but they seemed more vivid and my imagination filled in the gaps. I started out by seeing an x pattern. That was reminiscent of the death star trench run, where the x wings were shooting lasers. Larger close by, but then fading and becoming more acute where they converge.

I saw a Spinning wheel that looked like a buzz saw. Only the teeth at the end looked like cartoon lightning bolts closing at a point, probably about 32 teeth in total. The wheel was gray/black, and split into two wheels. Both continuously spinning.

After this, I would notice and up/down motion like water smashing down. Majority in the peryphery but if it was simplyer it could pass moving or just be there in the center I started to see ""cartoonlike"" lines of organic shapes merging into each other, and often a swirl at the center and a feeling of travelling fast  I stopped because it became boring. My best description is that there was a pale white or light yellow 'spider web' effect over, or within, a background field of slightly darker orange-ish yellow. i swa shapes and something like a butterfly and atoms like structures I tended to see images like our known universe; complex structures like Einstein Rose bridges, starships and alien beings not too dissimilar to humans, yet animal in varying degrees. I think everything or at least most of what I saw was cartoon-ish/looked like it came from a 2-D videogame. I saw a lot of trees and a lot of gears. Color-scheme was very monochromatic/red (anywhere from almost black maroon to pinkish white), but there was quite a bit of orange, yellow, and blue as well as some green and purple too. Most of what I saw was moving very quickly, for instance, a line of trees (cartoon trees) along the bottom of my screen would stretch tall and then zoom all over the screen (usually in a line) before turning into something else, or before disappearing under the metaphorical shadow of something completely new taking their place...for instance, the entire screen turning into spinning gears, kind of like one of those optical illusions (except its actually spinning). If I used any mental energy whatsoever other than ""I'm going to watch these gears spin until they morph into the towering sky scrapers that pop out of comic books and then trees rushing around the screen like bullet trains"", then I could see something a little more specific and *mildly* less chaotic, like a car treading up the steps of a pyramid or a cartoon monkey building a boat. I tried to not think too hard though, and just watch the screen like a movie that I'm not really trying to put any mental effort into understanding, so things like the pyramid car and monkey boat weren't the majority of the experience and didn't last very long. ı think ı saw an A I think I saw green flashing as a color on the whole screen throughout. No other imagery I think maybe I'm a bad test subject :) The flashing evoked images only in my head. The light stayed the same except becoming more similar to sunlight through leaves or bridge struts. It was interesting! I thought there were some geometric forms emerging.   I travelled back in time. I saw Tudor roses, Tudor hall walls, Tudor battles; then down a tunnel to William the Conqueror and the Battle of Hastings -- I saw horses bashing into each other, pikes and spears thrashing around. I was associated -- sitting on one of those horses, bashing hard into other horses' chests. I tried this at 12:34AM so this may have impacted my experience, but has definitely impacted my writing, haha. 

I would try this out at an earlier time but between how long this description already is and how getting a similarly-lengthed session at such a time in my current situation may be difficult due to noise, this will have to do. Sorry.

DESCRIPTION:

Throughout a lot of what I saw the simple red/black imagery acted like a veil of varying transparency

The first images I saw were pretty vivid. The very first of these I saw was a carousel of faces from a top-down perspective. They soon dispersed and I began seeing in black and white, with the first thing I witnessed being what looked like simple drawings floating upwards before a transition to furniture - like desks and tables - doing the same thing.

Note that for the majority of what I witnessed, it would continue to have this sort of monochrome black/white perspective. It was grainy like an old film or certain imaging technology like night vision, but in a way that you can probably see in some artistic styles, where the black and white were used to either indicate light or to highlight certain parts of a shape/figure/etc, etc.

After this I had a perspective of someone standing at one end of a rope bridge and I watched a black figure running across it, getting smaller as they gained distance from my point of view towards the base of a massive cylindrical object made of concrete(?).

Afterwards, I had a person sending forth some kind of beam of light that pierced the clouds above them, which then transitions to the next description.
I'd then get spotlights on various things for a while, but there was never enough white on the objects despite the light to make any of it out. Soon I had a perspective of the source of the spotlight though and it was just being emitted out of thin air. A person fell a great distance yet was not harmed nor bothered because they immediately began to run. Unfortunately for them though there was some kind of fleshy (the pink and the yellowy-white included here), sinewy monster that took to housing itself in this weird book/chest with sharp teeth (e.g canines from a carnivore) sticking out of it, much like a hermit crab. It was either bipedal (but with its spidery legs resting like a crab's, instead of it standing tall) or ""tripedal"" .Its legs were long and seemed impossibly thin (kind of like a spider's) for what it likely weighed, yet it lurched itself forward pretty fast and gave chase to the fallen person as they turned away and entered a full sprint. The creature was about to catch up but the person had just gone through a detached doorway leading somewhere else. Instead of giving up though, it fired a continuous laser through the open doorway and with that my first lot of complex images ended. 

I can't really remember a lot past this, though I did once have a perspective of flying through a void and zooming past what could've been a beautiful, stout vase-like piece of pottery. It was white and blue like fine china, except I saw the upper section of it to have maybe had enamel painted on it in tiny diamond shapes to give it texture, rather than being smooth.

Doing it for extended periods of time seemed to reduce the frequency and how often images would be notably vivid for me. This may just coincide with me growing increasingly tired, however.

 Trying out music would take away my focus from more complex imagery. During this time though I did repeatedly, very vividly and clearly envision a simplified big-round-headed humanoid figure that glowed with white and was riddled with moving horizontal, rectangular black shapes. It did a few things but I don't really remember what. I think I once saw it pluck a flower and try to give it to some obscured entity. Any attempts for me to focus it into a more accurate human shape would only last for a second at most before the images would momentarily stop, before returning to the figure doing something. Sometimes when attempting this manipulation it would just stretch out in one direction infinitely. Not disturbingly, but more in that odd, sometimes goofy way when something goes wrong with a digital 3D model.

None of the simple images inbetween the many scenes were really remarkable and remained as black/red only, but my mind would frequently show a lot of spinning patterns and also frequently turned them into 3D objects to rotate clockwise whilst it would continue spinning and it seemed to do this with a surprising amount of accuracy and consistency. Obviously this is subjective and other simultaneous patterns could've obfuscated anything weird but I still believe it to be noteworthy.

EXTRA OBSERVATIONS:

Observing the Ganzflicker with one eye would show intense perceptions of simple imagery with occasional transitions to something more complex. Either eye saw something significantly different, one sometimes more clear than the other. There would be changes in the geometry like how 'dense' the patterns were packed into the same area as the other, how blurry it was, what shapes made up the same pattern. Stuff like that. However the imagery was marginally less clear overall and would only stay as red/black. One time this led to me being within some kind of ring with a groove on the inside and the perspective was just of something continuously going along said groove at a high speed. 
After this when using both eyes I would envision a lot more tunnels, including a rail tunnel at one point that led to a bridge with a view of a ruined cityscape. A rotating perspective around a train that materialised out of nowhere gave me a decent view and buildings were crumbled and on fire (one part of the city was just a pile of large granules). This was also the only definite complex landscape I would witness, however it was not very clear.

Closing my eyes during the Ganzflicker also would produce new patterns. I don't really have the words to describe them but during one attempt they swirled like they were fine grains in a fluid I disturbed and from then on in that attempt I had a constant 'vision effect' of being underwater or looking at water being swirled or otherwise disturbed.

Coming back after writing all of the above and doing a quick observation was interesting too. I saw four sets of whatever you call those sets of wheels you get in a combination lock, in some kind of intricate device. Each were of identical length, probably 16 wheels long each. Some were scrolling rapidly, most being in the middle but a few towards the ends away from the centre of the screen also scrolled. They had numbers but also alphabetical characters on them. Returning my attention to the centre gave way to a growing white background with gibberish printed in text across it. The background consisted of straight lines and resembled an upside down T-shape. I viewed for roughly 3.5 minutes without blinking. I saw random flags and I at one point saw 2 presidents dancing in checkered patterned. A lot of distortion I was holding it close to my face. For roughly 5 seconds I looked at the TV and it was in black and white I vividly saw a submarine breaching, the number 7, and Xs. Also if i looked at the center of the screen it appeared as if the colors were moving away from the center and if i looked at the top or bottom it appeared as if they were moving towards the center I vividly saw blue flickers at brief points throughout the experience. I saw a thick curved outline of a complex shape that persisted for a few seconds before fading, like a thick black line with a few curves in it. I also saw a circle flash for barely a second. I was able to create complex shapes on the screen by gently following their natural progression. Usually symmetric and moving in a direction of my attention. I was able to visualize whatever I chose after a couple minutes into the experience. wow. I want one. I was aware of my thoughts and emotions and imagination, but nothing visually appearing on the screen, in a form of hallucination. I was disappointed. I was hoping since I can visualize entire movie like scenes complete with sound in my head that I'd see more than a flashing black and red  screen. Some yellow around the edge and some shapes but that was it. I was driving down a winding road when a bright red bean came at me. Then I saw a blackhole in the distance and it was sucking the red beam into it. Then I saw blast of shapes, starbursts, geometric shapes, it became objects like an ear, tongue, mouth wide open as if to bite into a large sandwich. Then the shapes again, and lots of starbursts. The last thing I remember is seeing a figure looking straight at me then turn to it's right, then vanish and the shapes came back. It was time to stop. 10 to 12 mins I was floating through space, seeing what looked like planets and suns, with long streaks of light as well. I was flying on the ocean then I dived and saw six eyed creature under me I was flying through a square tunnel, I saw two Chinese dragons chasing each other in an infinity loop, I saw a black orb inch-working across the screen, I saw a dancing ball of light, I saw a galaxy far off in the distance behind a web of thin red lines, I saw cubes flying in and out of the screen. Various geometric shapes that tended to spin around the center of the screen. I was going down a box shaped tunnel, twisting and turning as faces and animals appeared in front of me, as if I were running into them as I descended down the twists and turns. It made me anxious and nauseated & I couldn’t complete the 10 minutes. I was in the ocean floating on my back, looking at the night sky. I could dive under, or fly up, almost into space. I controled it. I was lulled into a sleepy state. It made me wanna really sleep. I struggled to keep awake. Once I had the auditory hallucination as if the white noise was making my thoughts beat somehow. ı was see my ex girlfriend ı with her in istanbul and we are leave in there and we are still love each other I was strangely connected to the screen and each time the speed of the video and the shapes it created were changing. I was taking a train trip somewhere there were many people on train, I was in jungle with tigers not frightening just vividly alive I was thinking about memories that I could make with my friends in the future. We went to the top of Mount Fuji and watched the sunrise. Then the scene shifted to the left to the sun and in the bottom right I saw the figure of the Eygptian God Ra or maybe Horus. I don't know it was the guy with the bird head. He was on the bottom right holding like a spear thing. He pointed it at the Sun. Then the 10 min white noise stopped and it went away. I watched faces, like a face that is on the other side of the screen, I remember seeing a jungle and the sea I watched for 20-30 sec,and immediately was disquieted by an emotional affect (i don't want  want to say anything cheesy, but i was felt like it was something I've never experienced  - excitement, unease, totally uncolored by 'conscious thought.'  I have a strong internal monologue.  Every sentence I externatize (write, type, say, sing) is absolutely dwarfed by the internal composition that was always been ""me""   -When the colors began turning into shapes, that turned into textures, gave away to ""structure"", i had no thoughts.  Im sure you're familiar with charles bonnet syndrome/hallucinations.  They would be ""experienced"" in the visual cortex, or there adjacent.  In this experience, I felt at absolute ""shift"" in awareness, concentration, consciousness  that was not angst-inducing, but I had to step out, to learn more about the project.  It was definitely a first for me - a first one of ""these"" I would see bars across the screen of the opposite color being shown. I also would see green between the red and black. I wasn't sure if either thing was a hallucination or was a display artifact of the screen that I viewed it on. I would see occasional flashes of shapeless green light intermittently initially, but after a while they disappeared. I’ve seen shapes then became a red and blue flag moving, then a blue river  Idk if I closed one eye (either left or right) it was like running through the stone wall maze. Wall on the left hand side of such tunnel/maze had very regular hexagonal tiles, wall on the RHS had stones of various shapes and sizes.
Looking with both eyes pictures changed over time, but it was an image of repeating pattern over large areas of the screen. Some of the patterns resembled:
- pineapple skin, or pine apple leaves,
- fish scales, 
- fireworks
- flowers growing out of the screen towards me If I could use one word to describe my experience it would be ""rotational."" Everything I saw rotated, and it was very dizzying. Sometimes I would see multiple points where these big fan blade like objects were spiraling around. Sometimes the fan-blade like objects would spiral into these points and get smaller and smaller until they disappeared. Sometimes everything felt so chaotic and impossible to interpret. There were lines and shapes spinning in my field of view, a translucent sphere of spirals containing another sphere of spirals and so on. Briefly, I saw circled that looked like they had a six-pointed star inside. The whole thing was very disorienting. When I closed my eyes it was like I hit a reset button. The visuals start with blocky, checker-board like patterns that start to rotate around a common point. Then, other points will emerge and morph. I never saw anything that actually made since as an object, only geometry. If I focused, I could see the colors change faster or slower, and instead of immediately changing they would seem to transition (like transitions from one slide to the next in Power Point).  Iı Iikk Illegible wording at first which I couldn’t bring into focus, a large X then moving lines I'm not know I'm not sure where to begin nor if the Ganzflicker was driving what I saw or if my mind was driving what I saw, regardless of the Ganzflicker, as my mind's eye constantly plays in the background of my mind anyway. Sometimes I can focus on what is being projected and bring it to such minute detail that it is as real as physical reality but it is fleeting, no more than a second or two for each scene such that it is hard to describe what I was seeing from memory. Most often, what I see is typed documents written in a language I do not understand, although in the english alphabet, sometimes a word at a time, a line, a paragraph, or even entire documents. It is formatted and looks like I am seeing a newspaper. I have tried to force my mind's eye to translate what I see but doing so tends to defocus what I am seeing. I get the feeling that it is possible to translate but my mind does not generate enough energy to do so.

Like my mind's eye, my thoughts don't stay focused long either. They bounce around quickly from one thought to another, sometimes connected to the previous thought but more often than not, irrespective of the previous thought. It's like seeing random Wikipedia pages. İmage going left to right. Moving in a worm. White. a ball with mixture of black and red. Images flashing in different parts of the screen. Sometimes in only outlines then flashing in solid black images in grayscale with red acting as the black. started as animal like faces staying for a while then shifting into a new face and then turned into flowing corridors and tunnels of texture and patterns almost like in a linear path video game. images of cats walking across the screen as if the computer was a window; biplanes and men manning them going in circles and performing aerial acrobatics, supernovas and galaxies of light spinning and rotating around their own axis of gravity; a quilted plaid pattern repeating over the screen, etc... Images of geometric patterns, shapes, plants, and birds morphing into views of buildings and landscapes with plenty of movement.  Images seemed to center on my visual focal point. Where I was looking at the time.  Images tended to start in the center, but could expand to the periphery or move around the screen. Images typically were geometric in nature, and often resembled a 6-spoked pattern. Symmetry was common, and often there was an element of rotation (either the image itself rotated, or there was a spiral pattern such as a double-helix centered in the middle of the screen). The spokes or spirals often had a stripped pattern to them. Towards the end, the patterns often resembled a six-legged starfish or jellyfish creature that seemed to ""swim"" across the screen. Images were sporadic and tended to be when the screen flashed black. The first shapes to form were a contracting square with rounded corners that formed about half way through the sides of the screen and moved towards the center of the screen in a repeating flashing motion. This then built to multiple simultaneous shapes at the same time. Flashes later developed into v shapes that spread across the screen, partly overlapping each other as they pulsed and flashed and migrating upwards. Most of my imagery was to some form similar to that. Imagine being at the bottom of a train looking at the train tracks head on, close up from a top view and that the tracks themselves are black and the earth that lies beneath it red immediate dread, saw a crucifix which seemed to mold shape and begin to rotate. After a while I had the sense of rushing water, which seemed to sort of meld into the suggestion of eyes. After a while it was hard to focus, at which point it looked like the flicker became red, blue, purple and white, and I was no longer seeing any clear shapes. Toward the end, bright, curving white lines appeared on screen, moving in long arcs like sedate worms, and shortly thereafter, geometric shapes which had a fractal quality and seemed to shrink towards infinity at the center of my vision; these shapes alternated between circles (which was the most prominent), triangles, and squares (the least prominent). The longer I watched, the more complex the visuals became, although throughout the experience, there were brief flashes of more sophisticated hallucinations, particularly eyes, teeth, and wounds like gashes. These became more frequent as I went on. Often times these more complex hallucinations were mixed in strange ways, as though collaged in a sort of cubistic style: sometimes literally, as though viewed through a prism; and sometimes metaphorically, as though a broken bit of white, sharp teeth occupied a part of the screen while a wide open eye stared at me from another. The latter evoked a sort of broken, predatory, animal face, with a deeply unsettling monstrous quality.  Immediately I began seeing complex geometric patterns. These were not simple elementary school shapes. They formed warping tessellations, they were both two- and three-dimensional, and they were moving exceedingly fast. These patterns often formed whirlpools that could spin in either direction. Eventually I began to get glimpses of more vivid images, such as tree lines, a sea of clouds viewed from above, a distant castle, a skyline, a nice park scene, and once, a Jupiter-like planet with a far more artistic surface. Frustratingly, however, these images were so fleeting as to be nearly unnoticeable, and only appeared in the black screen. About halfway through at best estimate, there was a noticeable change in what I saw. The geometric patterns became blurry, as if I had zoomed in on them, and seemed more like lighting effects flashing across the screen. Gone were the sharp tessellations and I could not bring them back. I could no longer see scenery, except for a tree-lined river towards the very end. Instead, I saw faces, some blurry, some sharp in detail. Interestingly, I only saw faces in the red screen, as if the color of the Ganzflicker determined what I saw. The faces only appeared for a split second compared to the earlier images, yet seemed easier to perceive. I could hold on to images in the black for a few or several flickers before they faded. The faces, on the other hand seemed to only appear in one flicker. Whereas most of the black images appeared to be the same size, the faces could be any size and seemed to appear in a far greater variety of locations on the screen. There was no correlation between how big the faces were and how blurry they were. Most of them did not appear to be any face I'd seen before. A few were recognizable types of people, such as a nun or a fancy looking man. A further few could have been people I'd seen before. Most of these looked like painted portraits of scientists and 18th century historical figures. I could even imagine them wearing colored business suits of the period, though I didn't actually see such colors. The red varied in lightness, almost to the point of white-pink. The black was much less varied, but occasionally gray or even white tines appeared. That is the extent of colors that I saw. Immediately I saw a pattern of circular red shapes with the extra space being filled in with brown/black. 

Throughout the experience shapes would very suddenly dissipate and disappear and bright red lines would sometimes work their way down from the corners of the screen and meet in the middle. Immediately I saw colors of all kinds and it felt as if the screen was breathing. I found myself very interested in how the edges of the screen would turn white and move inward towards the center of the screen and imitated a sort of breathing motion. At one point I saw a ball of light and I imagined that it was on the end of a sort of magic wand and it moved all over the screen with no pattern whatsoever. I felt as though I was supposed to stay with it and train my eyes on the ball of light, following it as best I could. The ball of light was white with blue emanating from it almost like a shooting star or something you would see in space. I also felt a presence, almost like an energy in the flashing screen and it became quite comforting. I did feel myself wishing I had seen more and more clearly but most of what I did see felt abstract, including the shifting colors, shapes and then energies of the screen flashing. Throughout the experience, I had the sense that I was watching a story unfold, even though I had no context for said story. That is just what I felt."

I was immediately reminded of the visual effects of gently pressing the heels of my palms against my closed eyelids (which I often do to relax or to reduce headache pain). There was a constant sense of motion, varying from a slow walk to a quick pan (e.g. a flock of birds such as pigeons crossing my field of view at fairly close range). Sometimes the shapes were uneven although still aligned (various non-square rectangles packed together almost seamlessly), but other times the edges were more curved, as if viewing through a net of string not tightly stretched.  The ""tiles"" were mostly red, although many seemed to have yellow highlights (as if they were actual red tiles, with their typically slightly curved edges, viewed in early morning or late afternoon sunlight). When the tiles were largest (and, so, seeming closest to my viewpoint) the white noise sounded a bit like the sharp echoes of a tiled room such as a large bathroom or Roman style atrium. After a minute or two (I quickly lost track of time), I saw what appeared to be reflections. These were very similar to looking at a twilight, evening sky reflected in a pond or river, with gloaming, rippling clouds in the center surrounded dark, organic shadows, such as those of twigs or weeds growing on a bank and overhanging the water's surface. These more photographic images were many, but fleeting, always emerging from the tessellations and then dissolving back into them again. I was reminded of the darker and more rhomboidal MC Escher drawings. Many of these scenes also seemed to be vertically reflected, as if in a vertical mirror (e.g. the intro to ""Dark"" on Netflix: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c399HPb01s). Sometimes these implied columns or tree trunks with complex color patterns, but mostly they were symmetrically ""scrolling"" at a common rate but in opposite directions, as if walking slowly while holding a mirror at an oblique angle, causing the right half of the visual field to be a mirror image of the left half. Whenever I blinked, I could see many more colors, including sky blue (occasionally orange or other colored) tiles with green or yellow borders. The tiles near the center of my view were smaller and more detailed, and this effect followed my focus immediately if I moved my center of attention closer to the corners or edges of the monitor. The perceived tilings which were almost entirely rectilinear during the first minutes, became almost entirely hexagonal after roughly 5 minutes. The ""forest reflected in a pond"" effect was the most common non-geometrical image I saw, and was repeated many dozens of times. I also perceived a ""forest sky"" image (essentially the same, but as if looking directly into a sky encircled with trees, rather than a sky reflected in a slightly rippling surface). The white noise mostly disappeared from my perception, but occasionally seemed to sound like a light breeze, twigs underfoot, et al. quiet, ambient forest sounds. Toward the end of the viewing I saw moving spirals very much like waves curling into themselves when crashing against a beach. The white noise increased this impression, and seemed to crest and fall along with the waves. By far the most common perception overall was of tiles moving by (as if walking past a tiled wall) but also quickly transforming from square to various rectangles, occasionally to netting, and eventually into complex arrangements of hexagons; however, the images, most commonly the ""forest in a pond"" and the ""vertically reflected walk"" arose and dissolved every few seconds throughout the viewing, and the ""slowly crashing waves"" eventually appeared as well. Immediately saw simple geometric patterns, squares, lines, with a distinct bright circle in the centre of the screen.  At about a minute, two minutes, the patterns had become more complex and kaleidoscopic in the four quarters of the screen, with the central 'ball' remaining steady the whole time.  This progressed into the ball moving and splitting into two, which then rotated and weaved around each other, the kaleidoscopic imagry continuing to get busier, including warping lines, similar to ripples in a pond, or a bad signal on an analogue TV, wandering corner to corner.  At this points I started to notice outlines of characters, definitely drawn characters, but nothing that I recognised.  Nothing outlandish, a couple of people and something with large, animal ears.  At about 5 minutes, I realised that I could see s 'star field' behind the patterns.  As the screen flashed blank I could see stars moving about as if I were in the cockpit of a craft moving in space.  The remainder of the time, this just became stronger, leading to seeing a planet's atmosphere appearing within the maneuvers being made by my 'craft'.  At one point I felt a little motion sick, but that quickly passed. impressions of lines, similar to what I see when looking at the sky and there are squiggles in the vision in fact, it looked like the shapes on old-time digital music players, sometimes red and black with red flashing around the middle. Sometimes there are crosses or something like that In first attempt i saw 3 shapeless faces and heard dog barking. In second attempt i was in a vehicle (train or car) and moving forward in a tunnel. There was spotlights in that tunnel. In general, what I saw was a human being who was speeding away from me. There were strangely dressed people lined up. They were like monks. (I'm not religious , I don't understand the game of consciousness). They were lining up and passing through me fast. In my eye stroke eye, I saw flowing images of maos of very jagged coastlines and multitudinous islands. The scene flowed as though I was scanning a very large map. With this eye, the screen also turned slate blue and dull teal. These colors mostly swirled, but sometimes formed images of rather stiff, 19th-centeriry-esque portraits, waste up, straight on or 3/4 profile, mostly male, some female (generally with big hair or bonnets).

In my astigmatism eye, the color stayed mostly red, with black bands rising up from the bottom  There was a kaleidoscopic effect with either hexagons (of varying sizes) or swirls, some of which were spinning circles, others more like galaxies. The galaxies (or hurricanes) tended to move towards the top left. I did also see some cartoonish faces, but the tended to morph away pretty quickly. In my minds eye an image of a painting but sketch like appeared of a walled building with a pointed round roof which was higher than other parts of the building like a tower, this roof section was the only item of colour (red) the rest of the artwork was black and white. stood off to one side of the walled building (on towards the right) was a small boy with a dog on a lead (looked like a jack russell) whose back was to me so could only see he had a black suit jacket and shorts but I was shown another image which apppeared of this boy sat on a chair posing for a photograph he was wearing the same jacket but had a white shirt and small bow tie(black). This clued me into what the boy was wearing in the original picture image (had the bow tie on in the painting). I was shown a further image of the boy at an older age, being about 11 or 12 years old. The original painting felt late 1800's to begining of the 1900s. In order I saw a “demon” wearing a cape and his face looked like the tragedy mask, a pear, and a shitake mushroom woth the stem tilting right and the cap tilting left.  All the images were in 3D, in the middle, and popping off my iPhone screen. It was really amazing and I enjoyed it very much, but I had to stop after about 15 seconds bc my eyes began to hurt.  They still hurt a little after 5 minutes. In order: A ball of light morphs into an eye of a tornado moving around the centre of the screen, which then turned into a cyclone — kaleidoscopic hollow lens flares, double helix, and a galaxy spinning.  in order: orbs flasing and rotating, turning into a tunnel. Follow the tunnel for a while and see it become more complex, like a lattice framework.This turned into groups of cells and the matrix of a bone marrow. My view zoomed out and I saw all sorts of images. Faces, animals, houses, bridges, an open book being closed, a wave crashing onto a shore, a volcano erupting, following the lava tubes into the centre of the earth. ect in reds, black, and sometimes blues, I saw fractals and waves for most of the time with some other shapes here and there. What I saw is comparatively consistent with my experience with LSD, which is seeing movement in existing things, but not ever seeing things that aren't there. interesting experience though. In the beginning a cross sign, after that a tunnel like a subway and it was running like I'm the train. So the ""X"" sign and it become three trees dancing around, more crosses and X's and a river surge with the sound of a river and blue but light blue, like the water was running too. More X signs and I end the session.  In the beginning I mostly saw black margins appearing on the borders of the screen, as it the display area was shrinking. The rest was mostly white/blue blobs or waves, curvy patterns changing regularly. But that was faint, I was totally conscious that I was looking at a red and black blinking screen, nothing felt vivid. Also after some time my entire field of vision was blinking, not just the screen.
For indication on my mind's eye, I have no trouble projecting myself visually in a book when I read, it's automatic. But I have troubles visualizing something in my head for more than a short moment, it's like snapshots. In the beginning I saw line segments randomly placed on the screen.  Then yellow and blue rounded squares appeared on the periphery.  An X formed in the center of the screen.  It was composed of short line segments that were flowing into the center.   The X morphed into an infinity symbol where the flow of the line segments was in a direction as one might draw the infinity symbol.  At times, a circular arrangement of dots would appear in the center of the screen. In the beginning I saw the colours red, yellow, and blue-black. Towards the end they changed to just orange and dark grey. I saw concentric circles and intersecting lines, and sometimes intersecting lines within the concentric circles. When I would blink, I would see patterns and rows of dots in the complimentary colours of red, orange, and yellow. In the beginning I was kind of nervous but was pleased to almost immediately see a beautiful farm on a meadow. The sun was rising and the windmill was spinning. It was really peaceful. Next, it morphed into a sort of sun in the middle of the screen that moved around and became a random star in the midst of a galaxy. It zoomed around planets and a very unrealistic and Dali-esque version of space where everything seemed close together and the milky way was literally like, a creamy river type thing. This being said, although some details stood out to me as they did, it wasn't clear in the way things in my mind's eye are, and it was if I could see the images but was mentally aware my eye was superimposing images were there truly were none.  In the beginning, I saw lots of geometric shapes. The shapes were smallest where I foveated, and in a grid-like arrangement with larger shapes in the periphery. I saw circles, hexagons (looked like a honeycomb), and diamonds, at least. I also frequently saw bands of vertical lines. Sometimes a large X or cross pattern that extended across the screen appeared. As time went on I saw little sketch-like patterns. They looked like the little bits of contours that you get from passing a photograph through an edge filter in Photoshop or similar. They never managed to form identifiable objects and were roughly evenly distributed throughout my periphery (not really at fixation). A percept of motion was intermittent -- sometimes looming or zooming or spiraling, and always a global percept. In the beginning, I saw random diamond shapes that merged into various forest scenes, then I saw boats, trains, and cars moving around forest scenes. Next, I saw rockets/missiles flying around, and I heard the noises of  rockets in the white noise, this lasted for several minutes. Finally, I saw laughing people and again more forest scenes and rockets that then turned back into random diamond shapes. In the beginning, I saw shapes like hexagons rolled up like chicken wire and a field of stars rolling by. But then, the screen started to move as if I were on a train watching the world go by, but instead of scenery, objects kept flying at or past me: an open mouth with a tongue, running horses, something rolling by. In the first 5 minutes, I saw geometric shapes and I felt like i was falling through the screen. I also felt like I was moving rapidly across a vast geometric landscape, twisting and turning as if I was on a rollercoaster. I also experienced the feelings of being in a rollercoaster, such as the feeling when your stomach drops. After about 5-7 minutes, I saw the faint outline of two figures dancing and spinning around. In the first minute or so, i heard voices from the right that were indistinguishable.  That stopped and was replaced by spinning balls of light on an axis that switched direction with each blink of my eyes.  At first, they were on a vertical axis but with time they switched to a horizontal axis.  After more minutes the spinning was on all axes.  For about 30 seconds, I saw a body of water extending out into the horizon with a vague object on the left.  The colors were for the most part red, yellow, pink with white balls.  Each ball rotated around the axis via a rod connecting it to the axis.  The movement was very fast. In the very beginning, a rabbit that came from the right side literally evolved into a werewolf as it moved right then when it jumped up a cartoon-introesque thing started shapes were going on and on, then a lot of different object, watches and clocks esp. then we were inside a skyscraper watching inside while moving and stuff goes on, then my eye started to hurt (I only slept 3 hours today) but anyways enough support for a wannabe geniuses and random LSD users who think they are special circlejerk I hope you enjyed my comment Including, but not limited to: several distortions like rotation, warping, shaking, zooming in and out, waves, repetitive hammering. Patterns like mosaics, mandalas, triangles coming in from the sides and top and bottom towards the middle of the screen, several white, black and red balls bouncing around, orange ""bullets"", starting from centre. Horses, dolphins, cats and dogs, several human faces (none recognized), skylines, motorcycles, pickaxes. Night sky with stars (rotating fast and sometimes slow) and trees around it, I am looking up into the sky, the trees' formation changes several times, oceans with interesting lighting. increasing blackness around perimeter Indistinct ""holes"" in the red field, with complex blue-green shapes inside (like looking at a canopy of leaves). Some bright flashes of radial yellow lines. Infinity symbol, phoenix rising from the ashes, mushroom cloud, square fractal pattern, flying saucer Infinity Tunnel initally, traveling through a wormhole. 3d rotating depth map of butterflies, moths, spiders, birds, ufos with fuzzy gray outlines. thin vertical lines of magenta/cyan. Initial imagery consisted of distortions, simple shapes/patterns, basic mechanisms and gears. Gradual increase in complexity and intensity; more intricate mechanisms with discrete components, ""megastructures"" in space, galaxies/vortices, occasional buildings, strange faces. As session continued, imagery tended to become more violent and disturbing -- clockwork mechanisms of many highly-detailed gears, axles, and pistons operating extremely quickly; monstrous, alien, or ""demonic"" faces, sometimes with many teeth, sometimes chewing, biting, or swallowing very violently (and sometimes from a perspective ""within"" the mouth and throat); suns/stars and other celestial bodies in plotted orbits, or accreting vortices ejecting plumes of matter; and more rarely, normal buildings or basic urban ""environments""/settings.  Initial perception of a fixed viewpoint with a circular/sun-like object near top center of the screen with some lines radiating out from it along horiz/vert axes, vague sense of something like tree leaves/palm fronds waving gently in the upper part of the 'sky'. Began to perceive a sense of motion, mostly linear, like the looking out the window of a banking plane down onto a landscape. Periodic sensation of rotation of the viewport, sometimes minor but other times very intense spinning. When I could sense coherent images they were mostly landscape-like images, trees/buildings from overhead or zooming past too fast to see clearly like looking out the side of a high speed train through some periodic barrier/fencing. Initially flicker alternated between red + blue/green/black with white [stars] like a starry sky mostly in the top of the screen morphing into a landscape (mid to bottom of screen) green/blue/black jungle landscape, then colors came back to red/orange/yellow flashes w/brownish lines that defined building arches, then peaks then the idea occurred of a bullet train thru fire + sunrise, then [as I believe my mind, searching for explanation] to time-lapse of a million days alternating with nights.

I was somewhat disappointed, because given the vividness of my dreams [example: neon tropical fish of all sizes swimming throughout my apartment w/out water] I had high expectations, but interesting none the less. Initially I began to see two black triangles one growing up from the bottom of the screen and the other descending from the top. They began to round out slightly and connected in the middle of the screen to create the silhouette of an hourglass. As the sand ran into the bottom of the hourglass it began to grow and sharpen. The perimeter of the screen flashed deep blue and the bottom half of the hourglass slowly transformed into huge black pyramid that seemed to glow yellow around the edges. Soon the angle began to change making the pyramid appearing to continue growing. I felt dwarfed in comparison. Eventually the pyramid grew large enough that it covered to whole screen. After that my eyes unfocused for a bit and it was just flashing but a moment or so later these abstract blobs appeared from the edges of the screen and began to float aimlessly combining when they bumped into each other and splitting apparently randomly. The blobs were all different colors but they seemed very desaturated while the background remained a very bright red. It had a similar effect to playing desaturated film or animation to denote a memory, or flashback and I gained the impression that I was looking at a ghost of an image. The blobs began moving to the right side of the screen and combining into one blob and turning a sort of cool gray color which slowly took the shape of a woman (from about mid-thigh to shoulders) facing the left side of the screen. The outline was wobbly and fluid at first as the blobs came together but they soon began to clarify as the movement shifted solely towards her stomach and she grew steadily pregnant. The background became a sort of desaturated greenish grey color and the woman's silhouette darkened considerably (but not to fully black). Everything slowly faded out and my eyes unfocused again. When they refocused I saw bright moving shapes and patterns similar to what I see when I close my eyes very tightly or press on them slightly. The patterns dissipated and made way for a black and white image of the pregnant woman from the mid-thigh up leaning against an ivy covered stone wall and looking out at a city skyline at sunset. Although the image itself was black and white, I got the distinct impression that the woman's hair (which was in a ponytail that ended just above the middle of her shoulders blades) was a light brown. Additionally, although I couldn't see much of her legs or her feet I'm pretty sure she wore leggings and ballet flats. At that point I wondered if I had any control over what I was seeing so I attempted to make the woman walk across the screen from left to right while trailing her hand lightly allow the wall. When this was successful I tried to make her walk back the other direction and found that this made the image ""glitch"" and that reverse her previous movement  as though I was hitting a rewind button or I could extend the landscape around her so that she could continue to walk towards the right but I couldn't make her walk from right to left. Once again, my eyes unfocused and the image disappeared. Now the screen became bright red again and images began to appear at the bottom of the screen (in the foreground) and slowly crawl upwards and fade into the background as new images came into view. They were all overlapping slightly and placed at various angles (a few were even upside down) each image seemed to be of a different place almost like they were postcards or old photos. Many of them were famous places like the statue of liberty, the Eiffel tower, the Taj mahalo, or the tower of Pisa. Others were less extravagant, such as a generic beach, a campsite in a forest, or an open air pavilion in a public park. These images were brighter than the the previous ones. They appeared in full color and while they weren't vivid as though they were real, it did feel a lot like looking through old family photos. From there my eyes unfocused one last time and it had been just over ten minutes. Initially I saw a ball or light and the background color changed from red to blue. Then I saw a linear style rose shape. Next is saw two tone red lines. Initially I started to see the specks of dust on the screen as stars in the nightsky, I then moved closer to the screen and I started seeing very vivid shapes drifting, colours, a grid shifting to the right, I could see my reflection which was changing shapes. I did not see any specific images such as a building etc. I would see shapes, patterns and colours.  It was very intense and immersive, I felt completely absorbed as if that was reality. I was still able to think about random things.  Initially I would have described the images as crinkled paper. After awhile--a couple minutes or so--I realized that they made me think of the blood vessels in the eye, with branches. I also vaguely saw colors, which at first were green, blue, and yellow, but became gray, red (more than the existing red), and white. All of these things persisted throughout the experiment, but didn't change much after they initially appeared. I did notice later into the experience that the images appeared whether I allowed my eyes to unfocus (that is, diverge, as when viewing a SIRD), but that if I closed one eye at a time the images became blurry or disappeared. The images themselves never appeared to be more than persistent lines or pattern of vessels. Initially it was rows of boxes flickering, those boxes kept morphing into rectangles and other similar 4 sided shapes with soft edges defined by the red/bluish black.  The flickering would seemingly change in speed and almost pulse at times.  There was a pink ""line"" that almost looked like a cut or scar that would cut thru spaces between the shapes, sometimes skinny and solid, others thicker with > shape lines pointing along its long ends.  The screen would seem to grow and shift in size, never to smaller than its physical size.  It would seem to move with my eyes, but never really leave its real/physical footprint.  Towards the end a small perfect circle showed up that would move around with my gaze, slowly rings appeared outside it, then the circles were highlighted in neon green, it looked like a reflection of light from inside the smallest circle that shifted as it all moved.  At the start I had a momentary overwhelmed feeling, but that lasted less than 5 seconds and never returned.  I remained interested and curious about what would happen. Initially it was webbing like blood vessels, then there was a strobe tunnel effect in the centre of the screen. Occasionally it would flash into a grid then back to the tunnel. Most of the time the red colour felt more prominent, but occasionally the black.  Initially just saw various symmetrical geometric shapes.  First distinct image was a single point perspective of a lakeside with trees on the left and water on the right.  Second image was a single point perspective traveling along side a car driving down a two lane road.  Third Image was laying on my back staring upward to a tree canopy overhead.  Fourth image was on my back watching an eagle soaring overhead.  Fifth image was traveling down a winding wormhole. Initially saw a grid, then after about 30 seconds it turned into a room with great depth and a circle appeared with 4 quadrants with beams separating them and they began to rotate clockwise at a rate of about 1 rotation every 5 seconds and would move from side to side when I moved my eyes. Also briefly saw an expanding arrow like a mouse cursor that lasted for about 10 seconds. The whole time the screen had unlimited depth. Initially the images were simple grids; then they morphed into basket-weave patterns and a pattern of roses. Throughout, the colors included yellow and blue. The images were not confined to the screen but rather seemed to float outside it. Initially there were bright blue dots in the center, like hot pixels. Later there were lines and masses that moved like swirling water currents. Half way through, the center of vision started to spin clockwise, like water draining but only in a small 1-2 CM section. Initially the black screen was showing up as grey but later changed in colour to various tones of blue. The red also appeared to have varying shades, from red to pink. Near the end, the ""hot pixels"" disappeared but later reappeared as a larger group in the center but more densely packed, almost like viewing a blue galaxy of stars. İnsan silüetleri, ağaç dallari, kapilar, geçitler, belli belirsiz harf ve sayılar Inscriptions as if hieroglyphs on stone block walls.  Whirlpools of patterns that looked three dimensional as if I could reach into them... individual faces looking at me but receding, vanishing ...small groups of indistinct shapes randomly around faces that turned away, but sometimes turned back to look me in the eye (these faces as if drawn with charcoal sticks, outsiized noses or eyes)  intelligent but detached. Not unkind  but indifferent. 
 Instantly saw a couple dozen blue dots which faded away after a few seconds.  Gemetric imagery comes and goes every few seconds; has radial symmetry.  ""Gas cloud"" receding or approaching on and off, color was cyan to blue or greenish. intense wave patterns. some twsting and turning almost like a rollercoaster  Intense X-shaped crosses with checkerboard patters appeared and disappeared every few seconds.  interconnecting lines in a grid pattern, sometimes like a cracked dry lake bed or cobblestones interference patterns that morphed as I changed my visual or mental focus Interior of an airplane from the point of view of the ceiling, in red and black: seats, objects; sort of a schematic drawer. A retaining wall made of sandbags, red and black; not much detail. Interlocking circles; Stonehenge; the figure of a man very briefly. Interstellar space, Faces, different colours,  irregular shapes It actually made me a little motion-sick. After a few minutes, it felt like there were just a lot of wheels and spirals, or I was watching the road go beneath me. Not much in the way of color, some dark greens and blues, but I ended up falling asleep briefly after 15 minutes. It all started with tine flames. Flames turn into many coments in the sky finally I see in bird view above an ocean or sea with soft waves  It began with a small ring that would pulsate outward and get bigger then repeat. This changed to a river like image that had flowing red and black water (the water looked like when you drop red and black ink on water). The river became almost snake like with scales and began folding on itself like. I then saw a globe with a ring on it (a few colors popped in like pink but they didn't last long). The globe split in half and formed a butterfly silhouette.  At this time I had seen enough and stopped

I did not see textures or many colors outside of black and red. The complex patterns however did merge and move fast.  It began with patterns of green arrows in triads, point toward one another, like doubled recycling symbols. They were spinning and circling, a dance which became more complex and chaotic over time. At about 7 minutes, I started hearing music, like 8-bit orchestral music, maybe like the score to the 80s Nintendo game Castlevania, except way more intense. When this started, frequency lines started appearing in the all the green chaos on the screen. I started to feel like I was flying along and above these green streaks running vertically and that looked like they had depth, like a shaft or a canyon. After I shut off the video, I was seeing green dots circling for a few minutes. It began with red and black geometric shapes. Over time, grey, white and green were added into the mix. The part of my screen that my eyes focused on was showing a red sun with a white center and a black glow on its edges. It was hard to determine whether the sun was following my eyes or whether my gaze was following the movement of the sun. I guess I mostly saw blurry images because my eyes were tired from the flicker and kept unfocussing, even though mentally I was very focused. The sun began drawing patterns overlapping with the »background patterns« I was experiencing continuously. Sometimes those patterns drawn by the sun were letters, the clearest one was an uppercase N. The most fun one that kept reoccurring was a swirl. The background patterns went from straight lines to spiderwebs to emerging and moving shapes that were sometimes organic and sometimes really geometric. At one point I started seeing sharp black spikes framing the screen, pointing outside. During the last few minutes, I suddenly saw something else besides the patterns: A monarch butterfly, centered in the screen, spreading its flapping wings so they touched all four edges of my screen.  It began with simple shapes, mostly small, exploding hearts. Then I began to see more complex shapes. In particular a long-neck dinosaur that then morphed into a turtle. I also saw large footprints walking across the screen.  It began with symmetrical, sprialing fractals that were sort of fuzzy white, moving in and developing from the side of the screen. They continued to grow and split, and several more fractals spontaneously began on some places. I saw more concise spirals at times, wherever I focused my eyes. I tried seeing things deliberatley, and I was able to conjure some 'cuts' or lines across the screen with serrated patterns, some spirals, and i could bring the edges of the screen in as a solid red, to some extent. I stopped after about two minutes. It began with what looked like simple Harvestman (Daddy Long Legs! Weirdest thing, I know; not detailed) scurrying all over the screen, then morphed into hard angles/lines. All of the lines were geometric, coming together to form a prism. I remember thinking, ""oh, crystalline prisms"". This was one of the colors I most vividly remember, the prism was gleaming. Then it morphed into a big X with like a vertical and horizontal line through the X, which then became like a butterfly (but not a vivid butterfly, like a sketch of hard lines and angles, if thats even possible? Like, Rorschach Inkblot. I also have the feeling that the butterfly was blue, but it had no color). Then it morphed into the prism again and would move in 3D (it seemed), forward and backward. Creating the illusion that I was flying through space. It was like I was flying through my computer screen--through the galaxy, but unfortunately, though that was very vivid--the actual colors and environment was overall pretty foggy. I could tell that I was zooming through space and flying really close to the terrain and dipping/diving--but the overall color of it all was dull. All of these happened repeatedly, but I noticed that every time I blinked, the image or whatever would change a bit--it was like the longer I kept my eyes open the more detailed and vivid the screen would become--but as soon as I blinked it would kind of reset itself in a way... so I ended up giving myself major dry eye but it was still cool. 

The images kept repeating--I could almost control it after a while so I got bored with it, which is why I didnt last the full ten minutes. 

The colors I most saw besides red and black: gleaming white, dull blue, electric blue (but this is the one that is a feeling), dusty brown/red. It began with what looked like turquoise clouds appearing from within the screen, which then gave way to a purple vortex emanating from the center, followed by a sort of being, almost like a Hindu god sitting with its legs crossed floating all over the screen and after that the turquoise clouds reappeared and that’s when my time ended. It begins as patterns (circles, rectangles), then many fireworks. After I saw a window shape like I was falling into. At that point began the realistic images (1-2 minutes more or less): a forest through the windows, a river, a waterfall. The pictures morphing constantly. I remember a door, a cave (I heard a sound like a trumpet), a railway (At the beginning, the images were 'coming' from the center of the screen to out; a moments later, the sense change from right to left. Finally, those images disappeared abruptly, and I saw a door with dark blue colors. The 10 minutes was over at that point, so I stopped there. it changed the shape of it's coil but it remained as a snake, I wanted to look away but I had the hardest time. It felt as if I could project onto the screen whatever I wanted: patterns, shapes, symmetries, fractal-like images, movement. Maybe I could do it with colour and organic forms and sounds, but it didn't occur to me at the moment (I guess was too entertained playing with what I could fashion on the screen.) It felt like a drifting cosmic vista, tunneling and morphing in plains, spirals and tunnels it felt like a ride at highway It felt like I was staring at an object that would constantly morph and change like soft clay, but at the periphery of the image it would start to taper and pull off the screen. I would assume the longer I stared the more vivid the images would be, but I could feel the images have depth  It felt like I was traveling down a tunnel made of rounded cubes, then opened up into a stream and then a city of towering cylinders It just felt like the inverse colors of the red photo receptors  It just looked like the black was moving around the screen and like there was spiraling movement, more like an optical illusion than an image just because of eyes becoming tired. It just started to warp and flutter. It waa like i was looking inside a fire. Flashes of yellow and orange. It looked like a cartoon version of a war, with explosions and mushroom clouds and a city on fire, but sometimes this would fade into circles or tessellations, then come back again it looked like a close up of a honeycomb, like I was inside the beehive, and it was alive, beating like a heart. The colors changed with the beating--red, green, blue, purple, brown, and colors that I don't really have a name for but don't fit with these five. lighter than red but not white--a sort of violent pink. there were other fractals and lines, but the beehive kept coming up over and over again. as it pulsed, it seemed to grow and shrink and instead of bees, some sort of geometric shapes were coming out of it. It gave me a mild headache.  it looked like a color shift and something akin to a graphic equalizer for music It looked like a great mass of trees. It looked like a mass of pterodactyl fossils and then a school of Salmon jumping out of a river.  It looked like a pic taken from behind a yellow-ish rock/small hill, in the desert ; the image was different nuances of yellow It looked like a whirlpool of geometric shapes and I was falling into it. It looked like an old school Atari game. Like Space Invaders; beams shooting diagonally and geometric small images appearing straight across the screen, blinking. There were red and black and white and green colors. Sometimes there were rounded arcs floating from bottom to top. Sometimes there were sparkly bolts of green and white shooting randomly around the screen. It looked like I was moving through the universe at some points. Sometimes the movement was very focused, as if I was in a tunnel, and other times, the whole screen appeared to show movement. I kept seeing a pattern of single eyes, almost like a kaleidoscope would do. The eyes seemed to have a smile about them - not threatening or eerie (despite essentially being disembodied eyes...!). I saw a number of other colors, mostly oranges, pinks, and yellow. I am partially colorblind, so that may have limited what I detected. I also saw a lot of rotation, and at some points, it looked like a radar graph with a hurricane on it. Nothing particularly vivid, but that was what my brain associated with that perceived motion. It looked like star maps or galaxies then overlapping diapers on top of the start maps then the lungs converting the dots of constellations between the the shadows and the star maps. Then 3d face but it was my own not the same as a reflection but close that part was disturbing and made my tummy feel queasy. It looked like the cities connected on the Ticket to Ride map, but without the actual map (just spots and connecting lines forming a complex web). It looked like the flashes emanated from different places. For a time, it would look like it came from a circle in the center, but then in waves from the lower right, but then just overall. It looks a lot like what you’d see in a kaleidoscope. Was mainly red but had a rainbow effect similar to light reflecting off the edge of crystal.  It looks like a zigzag in the middle  It mostly looked like I was moving in different directions, and the screen was my window out of a vehicle. I was moving very fast but could se a forest landscape and it looked like I was passing trees, some more in the foreground than others. Other times it felt like I was on a spaceship moving extremely fast, a hyperdrive type deal. Also saw spinning blades like a helicopter. Potentially my fan pointed on me influenced the images. Most things were red or black or green, with a bit of orange and yellow hue mixed in the red. It mostly was pulsating light that looked like alternating lightning strikes vertically and horizontally. The periphery kind of went gray-scale while the center stayed bright reddish. The lightning was more of a white-pink line that was pulsing. Off to the left it looked like letters shapes were appearing but if I tried to look at it, they disappeared.  It reminded me of past dreams It reminded me of underwater surface. I saw color blue a lot. It seemed a shifting pattern was present. I saw different sized ""X's"" in different parts of the screen and the other thing I sensed was movement of the red as if it was a viscous liquid, pulsing and oozing but both were fleeting and would dissolve when I noticed them. My eyes dried out and then they began to sting.  It seemed as though I was walking down a long hallway towards a room full of crisscrossing pink and green wires. It looked like I could pass through the screen into this hallway; the distance between me and the room at the end of the hallway seemed real. It seemed like the flickering sped up and colors other than red and black appeared, but other than that nothing of interest happened It seemed to look like large Xs across the screen at first, then the Xs curved somewhat and made a grid like pattern. Sometimes after refocusing, it looked like a ball in the middle it started as a ball of light that cubed outwards like q-bert.  

Next I saw images of people and what I thought was the future, a set of stairs, a snake that appeared to be behind the screen, making want to stop the experiment, thinking it was real and I had lost my senses from a snake bite.

Tetrahedrons and complex shapes, moving in the perhipheral screens.  Difficult to describe with words It started as a polygon immediately.  It morphed into a pyramid with stripes and an eye after this.  The pyramid was vaguely yellow with bricks but it looked like someone faded out a picture and drew over it with a sharpie that randomly would change colors.  Then a huge x crossed out the pyramid and it collapsed onto the X.  The X had an intense gradient.  The edges were colored but the center was white.  It flashed twice a second roughly and the edges were mainly blue and green but they changed hue. Then mossy boulders began to grow out of the ground beneath the X.  They morphed into a huge array of glowing cyan square pillars in some kind of water.  It looked almost like a nuclear reactor core but the pillars looked more like squared off Corinthian pillars than glowing metal.  At the edges of the X it looked like there were b movie prop lasers mounted to swivel chair wheels firing the edges of the X off.  It stayed pretty much like that for a while, with pillars randomly popping in and out at different places in patterns that were always symmetric.  The pillars themselves weren't and were all chipped at the bottom right front corner.  Eventually multicolored clouds of smoke began to work their way in from the edges to the center.  It formed little tentacles that looked like they were covered in moss.  I stopped after the tentacles. It started as a simple starburst shape, diamond with line coming out of the points, with circles ringing the entire thing, then that changed into a diagram? type of visual, like an engineers blueprint, then it changed to more geometric patterns with these ones shifting like the special effects in Doctor Strange. That continued and probably after 10 or so seconds of these patterns city skylines started to appear and shift like the patterns before. This continued for the majority of the rest of the time I viewed the Ganzflicker. In the shifting cityscapes I saw other things made from the buildings and trees and people, like when a picture of a face is made using other, smaller composite images. Occasionally the shifting geometric patters would reappear and then morph into mostly clear images. 

The colors I saw were mostly red tinted, and textures that I could make out were moving and shifting like old TV static. It started as shapes morphing into snowflakes like fractals and tessellations, then it was like traveling through a tunnel and then seeing things like spirals that turned into galaxies splitting and multiplying and continually moving closer, there were whirlpools and at one point I felt like i was looking down at the head of a giant creature of some sort as it passed under me. constantly shifting and morphing into other shapes and ideas. If i concentrated on a particular color I could make myself see it. Yellows and oranges were easy, blue was too, it was hard to make it look green or purple though. It started as small firefly creatures, then green diamonds, diagonal hash marks, waves (horizontal and vertical), film burn It started as warping grids, then shapes, then 3D things like cubes and such. One notable instance was a field of cubes that went on forever, like something you'd see in one of the video game Manifold Garden. Then after that it went between 3D shapes and something like the end of 2001, but more complex."

The forest image started out behind in fleeting glimpses of trees of bushes but slowly the fractals and shapes started to disappear and the forest emerged fully. It was like walking through a foggy forest at night with a full moon. I listened to the white noise with it and eventually it sounded like wind blowing. I don't know how long I watched longer then 10 minutes because the sound had stopped. it started out as a blaring red eye then morphed into a planet. i was then on a journey thru space. i'd imagine what going thru a wormhole would be like. very ""interstellar"" type images. space. planets. nebulas, stars. my vehicle was spherical. windows all around. skimmed surfaces of planets with natural and sentient life formations. went thru buildings. saw fracturals. towards the end, saw a dragon like beast. It started out as pretty simple strobing geometric patterns, like the ones you see when you close your eyes and press on your eyes. Sometimes they were curved, sometimes they were square. The sort of ""focus"" of these patterns was wherever I was looking on the screen. Eventually, towards the end, I began to see other colors in the Ganzflicker. Arcs of magenta formed, then yellow, and then I was pretty sure I was seeing the full rainbow from red to violet. Along with the colors came what appeared to be 3d shapes: they were still strobing, but the rainbow color sort of twisted and formed into spheres and arches that seemed to have depth on the screen. It started out as though I was in a bee hive. I saw the honeycomb shapes clearly. The color became more of an amber-red. I was traveling through the hive and saw other bees near me but they were more shadowy silhouettes. Then the light seemed to speed up and it was like I was watching a sun. It was solar flares and I was watching stars and planets move around. Then it was like I was watching the earth form and animals and mountains and rivers and such appear. Watching the time stream from creation of the earth to the present. The dinosaurs. The early people. The various people of the earth through time. Flashes of moments in history. It was like watching things happening when they see something on a monitor in an old sci-fi show. That type of visual look. I saw all colors too. Not photo quality but colors and images that were clear enough for me to know what I was seeing. It’s fascinating. It started out red and was immediately unpleasant due to the flashing between that color and the blackboard blue color.  Throughout the time I watched the flashing sped up.  Primarily the color was red contrasted with the old fashioned blackboard blue but then the red turned to pink and then orangey.  The red flashes had at first a center then an X and other shapes in them that moved around.  Almost every red or pink or orange or other dominant color (I am describing the blue as a background color) had something happening in it.  Sometimes the blue had crackles in it, like the crackling on an old porcelain plate.  Sometimes something similar was happening in the red.  I have ADD so I was struggling to pay attention because it was quite unpleasant. It started slowly, the screen appeared to widen, then webs of light formed. There was prominently red and black but soon there was purple and orange, other colors (blue and yellow for example) were also present but not as often. An X formed and when I focused on it I could see a corridor on a space station, felt like i was walking down a glass hallway in space, stars all around. Then the image morphed, I could see a railway car and a block robot placing containers on the car. It felt like the screen was a large movie theatre screen and on it, I saw explosions. Then a pterodactyl flying and Batman staring down. it started with a chessboard pattern of red and black squares, then a grid of objects made of three segment rotated of 120°, then a fuzzy image of a surface of water with ripples and a kind of reflection on the left side. Later this image was more defined like a clear picture of a river with rippled surface and the reflections of the trees on the left side. Then horizontal lightnings followed by a kind of tunnel entering in the screen. At one point a three dimensional shape, like a wedding ring rotating in the middle of the screen, defined by the black interior and the reflections of the edges and curved surface. In the last part, the discomfort coming from the flashing stopped the production of images It started with a frequent red spot (with sometimes a white dot in the middle) that moved with my vision. I also saw fractals much of the time, but they were behind the red: they were grey and white, and sometimes even purple(ish). The white/grey ring around the center red dot reminds me of what it looks like when I have an optical migraine (those are not a bad experience for me). That red dot morphed into lots of things for me though. I saw a dragon breathing fire and eating itself. I saw what looked like a worm hole into another universe or place of some sort, I saw what looked like a black hole and lots of the time I saw that looked like the universe growing and collapsing on itself: suns imploding and then exploding, creating white dwarfs and black holes. The whole thing was always in motion (much of the time the bottom was spinning or bending one direction while the top was going the other way (""top"" and ""bottom"" are bad descriptors here, because it wasn't the top of the screen per se, it was the top of what I was seeing and that could tilt, tip, move spin and bend in any direction at any time). The universe is what I saw most. Also, I found it amazing that much of the time I could see white stars behind the red and black screen - those stars actually grew out from the screen and I could see them well beyond the edges of my computer screen while I was watching! The stars were like watching the milky way on a starry night from up in the mountains, only they turn and spin and rotate the whole time (whereas normal stars appear to hold steady as I watch them). The white stars would sometimes turn into circles (that I can only describe as looking like animations I've seen of red blood cells), then I'd be back to seeing the starts and the expanse of the universe. Also, at one point, the computer screen looked like it bent around my visual field as if I had a curved monitor (I don't). That lasted for some time, and was very interesting! There is an article titled ""Deep Dive into Curved Displays"" on the Samsung website if you want to see what it looked like to me: if you look in that article for the part labeled ""Shift in liquid crystals alignment when flat LCD panel is bent"" and then look for the curved panel with the image of the bridge on it, that shows how the screen looked bent to me: the right and left sides became distorted - almost like the screen was wrapping around my head. I also saw tornadoes (of fire) and what looked like red blood platelets going into and then exploding from a blood vessel (the ""platelets"" were all very patterned looking, not like actual blood spattering). The most real thing I saw was an eye, which appeared in the middle of the screen for a short time (30 seconds maybe); it definitely belonged to a rabbit, then I saw about half of the rabbits face for a short while. I also had some lingering ""ghosting"" effect where I could still see white or silver looking remnants of what I'd been seeing before I turned it off; that wasn't bothersome or anything, just figured I'd note it. I found that what I saw changed if I was closer or further from the screen as well (most of the time I was about 12-18"" away). What I saw also changed and morphed to the music when I watched it with Pink Floyd, Dark Side of the Moon (I switched to music after 10 minutes watching it with white noise). It would slow down if the music slowed down and speed up when the music went faster.  I preferred it with the music, and I found watching it very enjoyable (although the red was a bit distracting, I got past that pretty fast). I did hear weird sounds in the white noise that I can't really describe now except to say that it almost sounded like someone talking indistinctly (I can frequently hear sounds like I am listening to a radio playing in the background when I have a loud fan running at night, and that was a bit similar to what I heard). I think it would be interesting to see this in different colors (or maybe have it rotate through colors that change), if that's possible? So cool! It started with a sort of fractal, coming out of a white circle in the middle, with eight grey branches coming outwards, which then split into 8 more, etc. 

After a bit the branches went away and turned into bright red ""lasers"" which swung around the image occasionally coming directly at me, which hurt my eyes as if I had a laser pointer shined in them, though not very powerfully. 

These lasers eventually became entire fans of light sweeping around, and then it felt as if the screen began to expand, and I stopped seeing the edge of my screen, my entire sight filling up with a massive red triangle, made of small blocks. This triangle moved up and down until it broke into two smaller triangles, one above the other, these continued to move up and down, colliding with one another, black chevrons appearing between them. 

I felt like my eyes were closed, but I could still see all this, the triangles violently shifting, breaking into a circle of white, surrounded by a cyan halo. It was around then the white noise stopped, and the circle turned into a heart, a black outline around a red and white circle.

Only now, typing this now do I realize that the main four colors were red, black, grey, and white only two of which were actually there. The white and grey just felt so natural I never assumed anything. The cyan however, while it was brief it stood out, and felt unnatural.

After some time, I kept seeing things, even with the white noise gone, I felt almost as if I was barely conscious, and I  had to make a massive effort to rip myself from looking, it just felt wrong, it felt like I was giving up something pulling myself away.

It could just be placebo, that I am working myself up after this, but all while answering this I have been shaking almost uncontrollably, and it has made typing a bit harder because I miss the keys and need to go back.

Now the shaking has stopped, and I just feel lightheaded, and my lips are numb, this may be unrelated though as I have anemia and low blood pressure so this happens quite often, and this is not nearly as intense as it gets, I don't feel like I am actually  losing consciousness which happens sometimes.

I'll stop ranting now, and submit this, though I think I will try again later after I get some sleep, because it is currently 5:30 AM, and I have not slept at all, which to be honest probably impacted this whole thing. It started with checkerboards of red and black, morphed into a cross in the middle, then into mandalas constantly changing and morphing designs, their centers changing based off of my focus point. I also have a raging headache at the moment. There were times there were multiple mandalas. This would switch back and forth from mandalas to what looked like frequency waves. When it was frequency waves there was a border around the screen, 2 lines, 1 moving horizontally and 1 moving vertically but they almost ""bounced"" from the edges of the screen in about 2 inches and then ""bounced"" back"" then it would switch to mandalas again. The colors were always red, orange, yellow and black. It faded out from red to orange and then a vibrant yellow was around the edge. Those 2 lines controlled a lot of the yellow.  I'm not sure at what point in time but the white noise stopped and became a deep hum almost. Thats I'm assuming when the more complex images started. It began with an outline of a heart at the middle of a mandala. then I wanted to see if i could have it be a circle and it changed the mandalas to circles, then squares then went checkboard again and then mandalas, it was constantly switching between these and eventually there was outlines of either a face or a bird in the middle, it was at that moment the white noise stopped and I turned it off. It started with flowers growing larger and larger and then a figure riding a bike imerged. On the other side a snake started to slither until it morphed into a dragon with enormous teeth. It started with fractal images, then there was a lightning of brilliant white across the screen, which later turned out to be watching a spark spinning rapidly around the center of the screen, but I was on the side axis so it looked like a straight line. Then there was imagery mostly like fractals, e.g. infinite cityscapes or like watching out of a window of a train with everything whizzing by, or flying through a tunnel of clouds. Then I caught glimpses of things like a room, or a person. I saw everything mostly in the scree, and slightly in my mind. I guess my mind was just trying to piece together what it saw into something coherent.  It started with geometric patterns, progressed into color changing (red, black, blues ((in different hues)), yellows, and greens before seeing actual white noise (the static from an old analog T.V. channel) appearing to somehow be beneath the red and black flashes of the monitor (it was an odd mental impression). From there, I noticed a black skull begin to form which I immediately disliked and began directing my thoughts (I do this in my efforts to sleep and am able to achieve conscious lucidity before finally falling into the first true stages of sleep). I was able to direct everything from vehicles (I could not stop the vehicles from moving however), to faces, to a rocky coastline, to mountains, animals, etc.). I would compare the experience to be very much akin to the state I work to achieve every night just to sleep. It started with nothing, then went into geometric shapes covering the entire screen.  Interconnected pentagons, octagons, etc.  I then began to see spiral galaxies, often tilted at 45 degrees in my center of vision.  These would morph and change shape and position.  Finally, the entire screen/field of vision began to ""move"" with the feeling that I was flying and things were soaring by me.  Nothing vivid; more of a sensation that I was ""inside"" the image.  It was very easy to lose track of time.  If my email hadn't gotten my attention, I wouldn't have looked away.  It felt difficult to not look at the screen. It started with patterns that reminded me of staring at a ceiling fan or powerpoint slide transitions repeated over and over, then it became a little more complex over time. Some of them were really vague, most of them were medium, but one or two were with weird clarity. I  saw lots of nonsensical things. Bicycles, merry-go-round like object, hand with word on it, garden gnome-ish creature and other cartoonish figures moving around and flipping. There was something like a race, but nothing was like literally a race track scene. It was all very jumbled and stacked, with a simultaneous views from above (the track) and the side (cartoonized car on track). This wasn't the exact order, and only some of what I remember. There was alot. A couple of times I tried altering what I saw, like trying to lucid dream, or just control how images move or what they do when you see them in your head, and I was able to change it a couple of times, but it was kind of delayed and weird. It started with seeing geometric shapes a few seconds time. This overlapping sharp line began to cross over the patterns, folding in on its self over and over again. I saw what I think looked like planetary scenes. Planets orbiting and over lapping each other. Lens flares even and stars as if I was flying in space. This started about a minute in and lasted some time. Near the final moments I began eyes mostly. Started in the abstract. I remember one there was an eye and a river pouring out of the pupil in a very pop art fashion. These eyes would start getting more and more realistic to the point of realism. The eyes ranged from just a few seconds of a static image to blinking. whole faces started to appear then, wish a focus on the eyes, nose and mouth. These faces were moving, they would just flash on for about one to two seconds. They appeared at different angles and different sizes. I didn't recognize any of these faces. They were just of men and woman. Theres eyes were really peircing. They didn't have any expression on their faces as they appeared all over the screen. I stopped the experiment because one appeared to be looking right at me, and it honestly made me so uncomfortable I lost focus and became so uncomfortable I couldn't continue. This all happened in about 5 and a half minutes. I only saw these in red and gray tones. It started with some weird ripple effect, then i could control the ripple, now the screen turned liquid, i can manipulate the flicker in ways that i was like water i can bend the screen. then i started to experience it getting bigger as i move back and getting smaller as i come closer weird. Then i could see the flicker coming out of screen just as 3d movie. 


in between i was somewhat seeing different colors associated with red too. It started with square fractals and fireworks and kept building up into abstract shapes, cells, hexagons, beehives and galaxies (or clouds?) that seemed to rotate It started with the red flickering and then geometric circular shapes appeared in an opposite color of the red (cyan?) in a somewhat organized manner, they were someahat symmetrical. Blinking caused them to fade. Other circular shapes without dots and little pieces were seen next and eventually I saw and upside down U shaped creature with a face, somewhat resembling a caterpillar but nothing like one, (similar to an abstract Dr. Suess animal). I might have seen a few other faint more vivid images but the majority were very simple and usually faint-moderate cyan shapes. It started with triangles and circles, then progressed to spirals. It started with two shapes in the lower right which resolved into a pair of partially-lidded eyes. Then a dark window appeared to open near the center of the screen, and a flowing landscape (like a flying over the ocean or flat terrain) began to scroll toward a horizon. It was composed of clusters of light blue light on a dark blue or black field. Then it shifted to a series of collapsing boxes, like a wireframe tunnel effect. Then the rotating systems started, these would resolve into fairly vivid spiral galaxies in light blue against a darker background or into mandalas of circles, eyes or bird-like shapes in oranges, yellows, and blues or rotating starfields (like time-lapse wide-angle astrophotography). These patterns would repeat, shifting between the scrolling landscapes, collapsing boxes, and rotating patterns. Occasionally more complex images would appear: a large bust-like head reminiscent of Giger's ""Li"" series, or a featureless person holding their hands to their temples (in the comic book telepathy pose), or a T-posing figure floating in space and slowly rotating (slower than the or rotating systems), or, once, a very vivid image (like a black and white photo) of playground carousel with clearly defined shadows. It started, and it was red, with blackish flashing, quickly parts of it seemed greenish, like when you are looking at a bright light, but my eyes didn't hurt, and it was like three big blobs on the screen. A minute and the blobs started moving around, briefly it seemed i was looking at a two-toned portrait of a random face. Minutes in and the screen was warping, and my eyes began following who knows what around the screen. These were like circles going one way, then swirls like on a screen saver, and once it seemed like people going up and then falling down a simple roller coaster. There was rippling ocean or lake waves a few times, shadows and highlights and all. It was flashing, and, near the end i saw a thunderstorm, clouds and everything, lighting striking the ground, wind blowing, and when i watch a storm come in i get a thrill, and i got the same thrill then, and i could hear thunder and rain. (tho the white noise sounds like that haha) It was still reddish and blackish, not full color, but it was like the scene. My laptop screen turned off twice but it didn't interrupt anything. I wanna go watch that storm again . . . lol.  Then it was kind of warping, and i started to feel bored, so i got out of fullscreen and stopped the white noise, and it said 9:57 on it. Almost ten minutes. (incase you want this, im going to tell you how i got the 'dark room', i got two blankets and put them over a table and did it under there with headphones upstairs but the family was not quite quiet so i had a bit of background noise. But it was sufficiently dark i think.) It took less than a minute before I began to see undulating shapes and patterns. Spinning circles, lassos in the sky, rotating flowers, stars.  It was a constant moving blob of a bright green that would transition into a turquoise, it felt alive  It was a grid and had a sword above it  It was as if the image was flashing RED then YELLOW.   Images were mostly spirals.  If I focused my attention on the edge of the screen my computer monitor's size would fluctuate 30% with the flashing like a spatial change from where I was viewing.   Very trippy. İt was black and red but mostly red and black was waving in the red but changing the rotation It was constantly morphing. I first saw simple patterns but within ~1 minute they emerged into more complex images such as hands shaped into animals (llamas), lightsaber battles, forest paths, wing-flapping, a baby tiger head running, rays of light, all on the backdrop of tesselating shpaes. It was cool, it was mostly squares rotating as if I'm falling down a 4 walled abyss while rotating. I guess I saw some animals but that's probably me turning weird squares into rabbits and other small animals lol it was irritating It was just kinda weird, enjoyable but weird. For me I had the static on as well, so I could only hear that. During the entire period, simple shapes and patterns where flying around the screen. At one point I saw an eye, but it was also just ""made"" out of the red/black like the other images where. NGL it felt like one of those cult like ""jump into another world type things"". At multiple times I almost felt like I was ""melting"" into the screen with static surrounding my computer; but it was incredibly easy to stop this.  It was actually annoying easy to get the patterns to change, as I only had to slightly shift my focus and it would be entirely different. Every time I started to ""melt"" into the computer, I almost immediately lost the feeling due to it's tricky nature.

Bottom line: It was weird but a fun experiment. I wish I could see some of the other crazy stuff I see on here! It was kinda like when you rub your eyes hard and you see light and shapes and colors. I saw this sort of whirlpool a bit left to wherever I looked on the screen. Other than that, I saw the color yellow flashing a bit. It was like a constant kaleidoscope, shapes made of shapes constantly inverting into themselves It was like a cosmic kaleidoscope, colors and shapes constantly changing and blurring into each other in ways that were at once ordered and chaotic. It was beautiful and slightly unsettling. it was like a hunter's fence whose bars flickered red/black against a bright background.  It was like a rainbow prism, but double and so each outer edge was red, and it appeared like a glare or prism in the center of my phone screen then slowly made a spiral motion and stayed rainbow, while rotating clockwise around my phone. it was like a really weird building, I felt like i was falling but all the floors were the same. it started to become more and more longer than the screen started to rotate really fast, in a moment I saw a lot of weird buildings that were rotating clockwise then the white noise stopped. It was like chaos. I felt I was travelling in a tube like structure being pulled in to the screen and I felt my eye sight and, in a certain way, my consciousness drifting away  It was like going really fast inside a tunnel with a constantly changing wall texture. Then from the lower right corner a flickering blue/green color started to slowly cover ~40% of the screen/my vision. And the last thing I can recall is wild flickering green/black with various images floating in from the sides, mostly resembling super dense/tangled lightnings or tree roots. It was like going through a tunnel with webbed patterns moving past at high speeds. it was like i am on a subway and it is going so fast, but outside is not a landscape, its just colors and shapes It was like I was looking down on a symmetrical temple It was like in the space. Something similar to rick and Morty or final space TV shows when they cross dimensions. 
first I saw a repetitive pattern of squares  moving and changing sizes. They gathered to form a rocket and fuelled it into the space. Then the square pattern became wider, like zooming and getting closer. 
after that, the pattern became moving rectangular and a bit horizontal. 
after that, I could move the pattern with my eye and head  movements and could play with its destination and started playing something fun where the pattern is the ball and the screen edges are the walls causes the pattern (ball) to rebound to the direction I'm moving my head to. I could also make the pattern move in circles. 
then the pattern was a rocket again, and it took me off back to space where I fell again in a dimensional spiral spinning tube until I arrived to a wider space where It was fewer patterns and more stable image of red. 
I could see blue colour and I also think I saw yellow too. 
after this I got distracted by the white noise flickering sound (could be that the internet was disrupted) and when I tried to continue. The white noise became scary, and I could remember that a lot of horror movies has this flickery screen in them and that my friend told me that scary film details yesterday and I started freaking out and looking around me in the room, so it ended very unpleasant, and I turned it off after around 7:30 minutes. It was like looking out the back window of a car at times, seeing trees on either side of the road disappearing into the distance. Also saw flocks of birds and spider faces, in a repeating pattern covering the screen. Intermittant 'rainbow balls' that floated without rhyme or reason. It was like one of the old sci-fi films when you were going through a wormhole. In the beginning, I was going into it, and by the end, I was watching things come out of it. It was like riding in a vehicle past trees, though sometimes I felt like I was being pulled into the trees. Occasional bright round flashes. Lots of triangles at the beginning which became 3-dimensional. It was like tv static shapes. Circles and triangles and squares It was like watching the old war cartoons with cannons going off to one side and then it would change to a city but from above so I was looking down on the buildings.  It was like watching tv. It was in a lush forest with a waterfall or river and a whole lot of houses. I saw a tower too but it was a ruin. It was limited to geometric and line patterns almost entirely, they were mostly red and black, every now and again they were green. Occasionally they had a three-dimensional quality to them. The shapes were predominately circles. it was limitless like the universe, starry night sky,  It was minutes between images.  They took up the whole screen.  The moonscape had craters like a planet surface.  I saw the ocean from sea level, the under water with light rays flickering down from above.  The lightening bolts were like fingers lasting a little longer than a real flash. It was above right of the screen center not the whole screen.  But everything was red.  No other colors.  And the flickering wasn't steady.  It would hiccup, or lose the beat, as it were. It was morphing shapes pyramids that melted into a spinning vortex then that shifted to look like one of those rides in a carnival where everyone is strapped into and uses centrifugal force to keep everyone in place then back to pyramids or city skylines  It was mostly geometric, at some points it seemed like a simple horizon line of trees on the other side of a river but simplified so that you could just see the different shades between the water, trees and sky. It never changed colors except to gray and orange. When it looked like a ferriswheel or just simple moving shapes they would start out at a certain pace and then get more and more violent/faster until they werent moving in place anymore but bouncing all around the screen in no specific pattern as if bouncing off of walls. When i unfocused my eyes, a gradient would appear, or a shape would appear in the centre of the screen. Majority of the time it was different shapes that appeared, but were never a simple square or circle. They tended to look like moroccan tiles, or characters of a foreign language, or like I said before tribal masks. The were portions of the shapes cut out, almost like modern art. It was mostly red with flashes of color, a rainbow here or there. Some blobs that looked like RBCs. Bigger images like trees and a lake would begin to appear in black and then my brain would skip on to another place in the screen. It was hard work for me. I tried glasses on and off, close to the screen and further away. It was mostly visual memories of a sunny beach in my childhood. It was pulsing, a lot of purple veins, the rhythm would change  It was regular objects at first, like a ceiling fan but in geometric patterns. The same geometric with the second one when it m0orphed into a sun accompanied by a tree. I saw flashes of road imagery and this slowly turned into smaller - much refined - geometric pattern which improved the visual of the image I saw. During this time, my mind wandered. I was apperantly going into the phone and felt the red color. Like a tint or filter. Once this stopped, the image became a storm tropper. I laughed at this but then in shifted into a rose. After 6 minutes, I stopped. It was similar to meditating on the visual field with eyes closed but the room felt a bit lit due to the laptop's screen and the laptop keyboard also felt a bit distracting ...... 

At moments it would get a little intense-ish ... colors would mix forming sort of an abstract art but I'd zoom out of it at times but then new kind of mixing (pattern?) would emerge It was sorta like an old picture movie with the spots flickering along the screen. Or when the tracking goes off on a vhs. Or a Nintendo would do when the cassette was dirty. It was fucking odd indeed!  It was spinning, or zooming in or out, in geometric shapes. I saw a traditional horn emitting sound waves from the periphery of the screen and I could see the compressions and rarefaction of the sound waves. I saw jets of pulsars, spinning crazily. I thought I was running backwards in a tunnel, very fast, and I could see the opening of the tunnel, somewhat flickering lights inside it, and I couldn't stop. It was switching between patterns to faces coming towards to a nice view froma pool kinda watching over the horizon. The white noise morphed into water falling from a water fall. Quite a pleasant experience. It was the seeing of everything. Universal energy moving quickly through space. I heard distant voices of men, and a waterfall cascading loudly down on me. I was in a red solution like lava,  it was not hot or cold. I felt very connected with everything that is energy. At one point I saw a large lol seeing eye in the center of the screen surrounded by white light. It was very intense with a sort of fast pulse of shifting colours, patterns, and flashing images. It was very vague and something that I've seen before during a normal day. It looks like when you're staring at the bottom of a pool and the light is refracting through. It's moving in a wave like way but the light makes a very specific form through the water. That's what I think I saw and that was about it. It wasn't so much images as it was a perception that my computer screen had gotten considerably smaller.  Next, it was as if the entire laptop had gotten smaller.  The result was that, even though I could see the machine in its actual size the whole time, a smaller machine seemed to float over the entire image, as if I were looking at the flicker on a small square, rather than a full sized, rectangular laptop. It's a mix from these three:
-When you open an mp3 file with ""windows media player"" and (right click) put the visuals on alchemy or battery
-When transitioning from one image to another, it does so in the style of ""Skyfall Opening Credits (HD) BY OddSun"" on youtube.
-When I was a bit bored after 3 min, I tried to manipulate the things I see in it. I succeeded and got to draw lines, a cross that spinned slowly and fast, a visual style like going through hyperspace like star wars, a tube where the circles (in the tubes that makes a brim) where rotating slowly or very fast where the next circle was spinning the other way of the previous one, ... . To sum it up, I could easily manipulate what I interpretted of what i saw. it's like being lift one a platform with red and black light at very high speed I've seen smoke-like shapes  I've seen some checkered things; It was as there were skyscrapers late at night, some with their lights on and some with their lights off. I've seen things revolving. I didn't see anything constant Japanese landscape such as mountains, lakes, trees, flowers, old style temples and buildings. Ancient Japanese people , very beautiful geisha, male warriors and Sumari, common people. I felt I was flying through history if that makes since. At the end I did see the mushroom cloud of Hiroshima or Nagasaki or both?? I felt very saddened but still, calm and at peace. I am not Japanese nor of any Asian descent. I do know alot about different cultures and history but at no time recently have I read, watched or thought of this topic.  Jgfcj Jhxxh Just a jumble of images in the green and red.  Much like where there's a new image every frame though some lasted a few frames. Just a lot of differences in flicker pattern, speed and sometimes the black looked like blue flashes. just a womans face  just balls of light Just checkerboard pattern, sometimes a big asterisk, and a little purple. just circles mostly.  kind of like a bunch of circles like you see after a flashbulb goes off or looking at the sun, but lots of them across the screen.  at other points it looked like imperfections on an old film video. Just different colors other than black and red. Greens, oranges. Patterns. Sort of exploding light  Just faint transparent polygonal grid and the complement of red, that is green, on the black portion of the flicker, but it blended into the red in fuzzy dots. Just flashing shapes in black on a red field Just geometric shapes and patterns, different levels of flashing brightness and darkness Just left hands coming from the bottom of the screen Just like flipping through a comic book from different direction, left right up down rotating corner etc., the colour turns redder and somewhat orange at the end. Just lines and small shapes Just looking figure shakes Just random distortion that didn’t create any kind of recognizable image Just random Patterns.  Most were moving and had sharp angles. just red and blue flashing lights   just red screen but sometimes it was blurry just saw other colours green, blue, pinks, purples Just shapes/movement/black/red/blue Just some wavy lines and amorphous shapes here and there.  just some weak blinking patterns Just something like shadows, dancing (flickering) finger-like shapes, or maybe like a bunch of slim tree trunks, somewhat below the center. Occasionally a spot of light at the center. Then not much of anything for about the last 4-5 minutes. Just the shimmering of red and black, sometimes sepia and a kind of green Just vague shapes. It made me nauseous so I stopped.  just vortex"

A lot of continuous patterns that scrolled like an old TV where the vertical hold was messed up.  Keep sawing a heart shape Kind of like stars. Laser-y, blue patterns kind of looked like a simple wheel purely made out of black lines spinning at a very highspeed while rotating around kind of rainbows but not clear Kind of white balls, shape of what looked like a person, white lines connecting each white balls. kırmızı ve siyah renklerin haricinde zamansal ve boyutsal açıdan açılmış bir kapı Landscapes, patterns and colours (less detailed than in my minds eye with closed eyes) Large coiling red & black snake. Wormholes in space. Rifts in space opening to reveal faces, geometric shapes, tentacles. A large spaceship traveling quickly. A row of cylindrical mountains (common in Nintendo art). Clouds. Largely rotating, vortex-like phenomena. Some kaleidoscopic sort of imagery. Flame shapes. At one point, potentially a door. laser lines, shapes, eye of sauron from the lord of the rings looking shapes Lasers shooting eachother, a plane, a cross (not religious), heart beating, falling down shaft Lasers, square and round patterns, stars, phoenix Layers of complex geometric shapes, constantly transforming and rotating to multiple different directions at once. I was able to control the rotations with my mind but it always took around 3 seconds to gradually change to the direction I was thinking about. The shapes I could not seem to control with my mind. Blue and green dots were scattered around in a regular pattern. Dark circles/cardioids and rectangles inside rectangles and were among the more common shapes. At some point the overall view looked like flying around a galaxy in outer space. At other points it was like watching multiple overlaid fractal zoom videos. Lazer and fractures, similar to how dmt would give you visuals. lazers, infinity symbols, balls of light in different colors :green, yellow and magenta, patterns like in the old vidio game galaga when the bugs attack Letters forming in to the words 2D,blue dots with yellow webs ,i inverse image of my face (my face was dark),third eye letters of the alphabet, spread out like a wordsearch, appearing all over the screen  Letters, numbers, and stars. Saw a purplish color, saw blue. Letters, shapes, different font types Letters/Images Light bluish, black, white and yellow lines like hallways or ramps ascending into the red. Melting swaths of star like light bodies, pulsating, morphing and rising from the red like a sea then receding or fading back in. Upward and outward moving grids in cross, cube and triangle shapes. light of different colors in the universe running to a planet, nebula, something like explosion, diferentes colors whirling Light particles streaming really fast in a figure 8 (infinite) movement, but the shape itself also changed in rotation and scale Light spiraling in and out, other colors like blue, shape of two lights almost like lungs Light spirals/circular movement, not much else Light-colored lines, X's of light color, bands of light and dark colors, also had several experiences where it seemed like sun ray at dawn that moved on the screen left to right. In total, everything I ""saw"" seemed to be liner - no rounded objects whatsoever lights turned into spinning wheels with multiple darker spokes rotating very fast. at one point was like coming up to the surface from underwater at a beach. like a black thick grid of squares ... like a checkers board in the center of the flicker. it did not flicker properly, it jumped beats. the outside of the flicker kept changing in size length wise. longer like a rectangle screen and then shorter like a square screen, flowing back and forth. finally it was the colours. the grid was a red and black, but the rest of the flicker started with a red flash, and then it started to have yellow/orange tones with a slight blue/green lining Like a delamination as if there was 2 or 3 screens on top of each other. The screen had some depth to it. like a grid of squares and then a gash kept appearing in my screen Like a kaleidoscope this time, still constantly changing, unable to keep anything in place. like a matrix evolving into diferent shapes and forms like a sheet of glass that was cracked but not in a particular shape like a star like a tunnel of polygons changing color with each flash back and forth like a tunnel, waves, sparks, a firework sparkler, the flashing seemed to speed up and slow down and sometimes merge into one image Like a tunnel, with a teeny dark shape at the very end. Spinning the tunnel. My field of vision shifted too after a while so it felt like I was focused on an area inches closer to me than the screen. sometimes a left to right stream like something going by very fast so it was blurred out and I couldn't see, but it was moving left to right. like an oscilloscope, sometimes more red then black. sometimes a swirl effect or left to right movement. also multipole directions left/Right. sometimes a. bit of a drifting feel. Like being submerged in water or going  through an abstract colour pattern forest, it was very beautiful abstract patterns suggesting forest or treetops or a pathway or roadway or looking up from underwater. A couple of times I tried to imagine an image more clearly but it was a forced thing, so I just went with what my brain wanted to see. A lot of orange red and some dark blues and greens that contrasted, mostly black contrasting patterns. Like bubbles, spiralling outwards. Then tree/branches around the outside of the screen. Always shadows/shapes, sometimes blue in colour. Like flying through tunnels at first. Then changing to a flying over rolling hills experience. That then turned into spinning circular shapes orbiting each other. Then those shapes merged into one large spinning circle and then the tunnels started over again. There was also a sense of anxiety at first, the feeling of falling, when I overcame that is when the rolling hills appeared and I felt more relaxed.  Like I was moving in it and with it; rolling streets, hills, sometimes a mouth would turn into a waterfall; bizarre images, some birds like in the space or able to see something like in atom speard out with X symbol and sometime appear like the slash light cut fly out next to my eyes. Like lightening; bird wing shapes; smooth red,  like looking at a center helix like area, either like at a sun, or like going down a tornado's tunnel, with everything spinning around it, sometime clockwise, sometimes counterclockwise. Like looking up through trees in a forest Like moving in a wormhole and the horizon was constantly moving of the wormhole Like paragraph in a book Like police lights and circles Like really good camera movement, filming space (stars, planets etc). like ripple but  in black  and red color  like stick figures like strands of peals the spin in spiral twist, then turned into the feeling of traveling away from center focus in space. like the screen size was changing as well. Images were also more like a kaleidoscope like the screen was folded (similar to an unfolded origami figure), denim blues, fungal greens, lots of white like travelling through a tunnel or pipe, sometimes towards the screen sometimes away, the tunnel was round, square or ovoid, and very occasionally shaped as a + 
It was often pink on Blue or green.
I also had bright green swirls that would spin at a great rate often moving in a circle
All of these would only last a second or 2, 3-4 seconds at the extreme, before my eyes would refocus and the image was gone.
Within a second of looking at the screen, colours went to pink/blue with occasional orange, green and blue Like zooming through an asteroid field, asteroids everywhere Line moving circles  Line of bright line cutting vertically through the screen, several shapes like circles and squares, the very faint image of a face shape (but more similar to a jack-o-lantern cutout of a face than a real one), and lots of blues, greens, and yellows Line patterns like organic chemical diagrams, hexagon grids, grassy meadows, strange things in the periphery of my vision especially during periods of tunnel vision  Linear patterns intermittently seen lines lines Lines Lines all over, like shattered glass.  Constantly red or green blobs on top of the lines.  Then the screen started moving upwards on the monitor, like it wanted up and out of confinement. lines and bars going across the screen.  At the end the flickering expanded past the edge of my screen. lines and blocks lines and cross sections traveling in paths sometimes non linear paths blue x's or crosses and a sensation of me diving inside a blue galaxy like the superspeed thingy in the star wars movies ,overall the sensation of moving in and deeper into a blue galaxy was consistent throughout the watching   Lines and crosses Lines and jaggred shaped, spots, and they were jumping around the screen Lines and patterns Lines and shapes some bright others muted constantly moving around, sometimes it appeared like the sky or the ocean with waves or clouds. I saw the colors yellow and green besides the black and red.  Lines and small curling shapes like semi circles  Lines appearing, growing and converging, like a simple cartoon on a flipbook. lines converging in an x wherever my line of sight was, sometimes a slight swirl, infrequently a series of lines converging in a * pattern. Some visual artifacts that were probably ""floaters"" in my eyes. Lines everywhere like scratches  lines geometric shapes. more so when white noise is heard Lines in a grid, circle swirling all yellow ish Lines made of white light, pulsing balls of light, spinning motions almost like a spiral Lines moving across the screen; flashes of green; “chain link fence” pattern lines moving around, like worms moving around in circles Lines of yellow-green light and white lightening filled the background while vague shapes in shades of red emerged like in a fog. The edges of the screen grew dark like an old window, spider-web lines wriggling. In the periphery beyond the screen, it felt and appeared similar to a sleep paralysis episode, although much milder. Most shockingly, the flickering red seemed to sometimes expand to fill my vision and become painfully bright, or othertimes shrink and dim. Lines radiating from center lines swiping across the center diagonally, first on one diagonal, then the other, followed by both together making an ""X."" Sometimes a series of small circles orbiting the center of the screen. Sometimes squares, but for all I know those were artifacts of my monitor's refresh rate. Lines that reminded me of the phasers in Star Trek crossing at different angles. They looked like streams moving in different directions. Sometimes two crossed in the center of my vision and rotated. Other times, up to five converged, again, at the center of my vision. I could tell they were four different lines because they seemed to flow towards the center.

I also saw circles that expanded from the center. Those reminded me of migraine auras. Lines, bars, castle/brick/stone walls, red light, yellow light, blue light, green light, a sun growing, movement in different directions, a highway from the perspective of driving fast along it, the outlines of mountains in the distance, many more images I can’t remember… lots of movement  lines, blury objects like a door, almost trees  Lines, curves, ball of lines 🧶, the substance of God Lines, geometric shapes lines, grids, spiderwebs, triangles lines, hollowed out x, and celtic sigils morphing constantly"

 lines, patterns and lots of color from green to purple to blue to yellow lines, spiderwebs, geometric shapes, cracks lines, squares, dots, spirals lines, waves, patterns, webs, squares...  constantly moving lines，sometimes crossed，yellow and blue，sometimes like a rainbow Little crosses like barbed wire. At one point, a simple eye (black). The light moved up and down and looked like it zoomed in and out at points. Sometimes looked green. Felt like it was pulling me in at one point, when there was less flashing. When I blinked they went away. Little interconnected light balls like a grid Little tv screens with static, grids, colorful spinning wheels, variously rotating red fan blades looked like a couple of exploisions with differend sizes looked like a galaxy or black hole, when you closed your eyes I saw a  brillianant green and blues dotlike matrix Looked like a landscape or cityscape.  Started with what looked like a medieval castle with walls, and morphed to a cityscape, followed by hills. Looked like a reflection of the window behind me w different colors and some shapes Looked like arties or veins Looked like lines of blurry text. Some color shifts to dark or deep green Looked like lines of blurry text. Some color shifts to dark or deep green Looked like patterns turned into a figure walking across screen. Reminded me of an old video game I played as a child. Castelvania 2. The image was animated in the same way as the video game character actions are in the game. Looked like tadpoles all over the screen, constantly swimming and moving. Sometimes it was straight lines and others were definitely little swimming animals  Lots and lots of complex geometric patterns, followed by the gradual appearance of a night sky seen through a flickering flame, then with trees around it.  After a while, fleeting glimpses of cars and at one point a chicken.  Then back to patterns, but with a feeling like watching fence posts or telegraph poles rapidly passing by when sat on a train. Lots of activity on the center, like bright spiderwebs and 3-D stacked blobs coming up out of the screen. The edges were scalloped and constantly undulating. lots of beautiful blues, turquoise, lime green...grids, soft mounds of texture moving that were brick reds/oranges, tiny spots of blue/turquoise lots of blue, at first just lines and then it seemed to mostly be blue Lots of bright colors, different shapes, lots of different animals, meadow with flowers, knights, volcano, people running Lots of complex fractals, triangles, balls of light that moved, something that looked like a spiral galaxy in the center of my vision for several seconds. Lots of different patterns in the way the colors moved. I saw red, blue, purple, yellow, orange, pink. Sometimes there were dots (like one single giant dot) or a line/lines. There was a cityscape with skyscrapers for a brief moment.  Lots of dots inside moving circles. Squares moving. Words I couldn’t read lots of eyes Lots of eyes, usually in green or dark blue. At one point there was a black and blue waterfall with a rainbow slanting downwards. I saw cell mitosis as well, in lighter red, dark blue, and neon green.  Lots of eyes. No pairs of eyes, just singular eyes all over the screen. Lots of fractals and spider webs Lots of geometric patterns (diamonds, grids of crosses, boxes in boxes) .  I then saw a road rhythmically swerving, then became  a snake which became a pair salamanders wriggling on a wall, this went back to starbursts of sparkles.   I wanted to keep going, but my head began hurting and my eyes were tiring out quickly.   I only lasted about 4 minutes. lots of geometric shapes that would expand, like i was fly through a tunnel, like those fractal videos of infinite zooming on complex 'random' shapes. A common on though was grid like 3d space of a maze that i was flying through. It looked very similar to the original doom 3d view. No cornering but a hall way of doors and corridors that morphed as I passed by lots of geometric, kaleidescope like patterns, tunnels, rotatating shapes lots of geometry mostly. Lines, dots, shapes, almost as if drawn. My visual field felt very much as if I was doing one of those mind trick pages where you put your nose at the center and slowly pull it away to reveal a hidden image. Further into the Ganzflicker, my visual field felt consumed by the flashing, and the white noise seemed to sync. lots of geometry, simple moving shifting shapes Lots of green flashes morphing into 3D geo patterns that would rotate clockwise and then another set of 3Dgeo patterns rotating counterclockwise at the same time. Lots of lines  lots of morphing lines, figure 8s. black bead shapes comprised the lines. Lots of mountains, a farmhouse. A rainbow ribbon bouncing like a screensaver. A hero with a shield Lots of movement like gears, moving mechanically but in a fluid way. Lots of grids moving in spirals. The first thing I noticed was a grid with four sections, split up by four lines that met in the middle around a circle. It wasn't an evenly spaced grid, it looked more like a cross or a window with the light coming through the frame instead of the panes. This grid came back to me the most throughout. I got a lot of flashes of green at the beginning and had some yellow and blue flashes as well. The color variations lessened as it went on and it became mostly red. Sometimes the peripherals would get this spider web effect and warp inwards. Most of the images were centrally located but the times that I focused less, I saw more pulsing chaos, fuzzy forms bouncing horizontally. Lots of moving colors and color changes. Blues and green were most seen. Saw two images looked like skulls  Lots of moving patterns around the screen, similar to what happens if you press in on your eyelids or something. Consistently a ball of light in the middle. At one point there was a dragon-like shape on the left spewing an s-shaped stream of something across the screen, but it was unclear and over quickly. Same thing with a series of lines and bubbles moving up from the bottom of the screen, like flowers growing. The patterns did grow a bit more vivid as time went on, but seemed to hit a plateau after about 5 minutes. I was getting irritated so I stopped. lots of plasma-looking blue, purple, white shapes.  symmetrical kaleidoscope patterns.  3d shapes like those 90's craze cross-eyed things.  faces Lots of point shapes, mostly triangles like shattered crystals. Sometimes morphing into natural objects such as faces, trees and the front view of a wolf head. Lots of rotating/drifting geometric patterns with strobing effects.Some looked like spirals, some looked like a directional light ""spinning"" (alternating between the light & dark side.) Others looked like 2-D patterns that would drift over the screen (like an old TV with improper vertical/horizontial sync.) Lots of rotation: spiderwebs, spirals, suns, stars and galaxies, turning forest landscapes, turtle patterns. In the beginning the patterns were 2D red and black with stark contrast, after a few minutes other colours appeared (yellow and turqoise mainly) and the images became more complex and 3D Lots of shapes and basic static patterning, kinda felt like i was watching explosion happen. At some point felt like I was in a movie theatre.   Lots of shapes and colours, moving in and out of the screen. It reminded me of comic book pictures. At times there were more complex pictures, but they moving so quickly and were so overlaid by other shapes I couldn't get a good look at them. Many of the patterns were very pretty to watch as they moved into and around and out of the screen. At times it seemed 3D, or like the images were swirling all around me. lots of shapes and geometric figures spinning. saw peter pan flying around, saw some dragonflies. saw what looked like a city with buildings. Saw a lot of blue and pink mixed into the red and black. There was also white noise above and below the screen. kind of like when you have the TV on with no channel and its white noise with the little dots flying around. saw the same image of a spinning pinwheel with a point coming towards me several times. The edges were not as vivid as the center and top and bottom of the screen. lots of shifting motion, moving like elements, wind, fire. mostly was black and red but would occasionally shift to white, yellow, orange lots of shifting patterns starting around 5 minutes in.  began as a single line that looked like a laser but shifted in multiple patterns and swirls that would move about the screen.  Colors initially were just red and black but eventually yellow, white and greens came into view. lots of spinning objects and ripples emanating from central circles, then visuals related to movement like, zooming landscapes/buildings as if from a car, through a curving highway tunnel, hallways, spaceship in warp tunnel. Once a 2D-childs drawing with the sun radiating geometric rays. Once a carousal of those chinese waving cats. Then spinning tessellated cats of a different art style.
Visual quality limited to outlines and shading, but no fine detail, like unpainted virtual objects. Rarely+sometimes visuals had more detail. lots of spiraling tunnels, some pillars Lots of spirals and billowing movements, like when you pour milk into coffee lots of spirals, flashing cross shapes, sometimes the whole screen seemed to rotate Lots of star like shape. Like outer space. Also an Oz like building. Lots of swirling lines and shapes to start followed by what seemed like corridors and tubes though which the screen was moving. Also saw a rotating and flipping galaxy type shape often. Later images stated solidifying into what I can only describe as close up images of medieval armour or perhaps modern architecture Lots of tunneling effects, like I was speeding through a tunnel, either forward or backwards.  Fractals, lots of spiraling things, like pinwheel galaxies.  Flames, orange and yellow light.  Then faces, faces looming, then backing off.  Sometimes I would see static, other times the view would come clearly and sharply into view. Lots of V shaped lines, a few streaks as well. Any vivid ""hallucinating"" i witnessed was as a result of day dreaming while watching the Ganzflicker.  Lower left quadrant seemed overly active Luxury M C Escher-like geometric interlocking shapes Mainly fractal or repeating geometric shapes, originally fixed on the screen, then moving either left, right, oscillating back and forth, swaying, or rotating depending on how often I blinked my eyes, and the direction of my gaze with respect to the center of the screen. For example, if I gazed right, the images would begin streaming to the right and vice versa if I gazed left.  After a while, if I stared at the center of the screen, the images always seemed to begin rotating clockwise, at a faster and faster rate until I would blink or change my gaze. After the initial few seconds, I never saw stationary images again. I was viewing on a 34"" curved monitor. Mainly Geometric shapes and for lack of a better term motion blurs. More complex images started towards the end in the shapes of eyes and faces. mainly geometric shapes, primarily squares within squares, and intensifying as I watched.  It felt as though I was on the verge of seeing more and I felt unpleasant while viewing an listening.  The intensity of the unpleasantness (anxiety?) increased and then leveled off at a medium level while my vision was (seemingly) anticipating a visual breakthrough (for lack of a better term). Unfortunately (or fortunately because of the relief) my dog entered the room and distracted me which I took advantage of to stop the white noise and ganzflicker.   mainly grids with black fill-in, some with white stroke; appear in different sizes, some with symmetrical sizes and some get bigger from top down; occasionally I saw some green but not very intense Mainly lines Mainly red fladhing screen with indistinguishable black shapes to right side of screen Mainly shapes, space objects and phenomena, as rising stars, galaxies spinning and warp tunnels I was sucked in. Then some shapes and objects, actually geometrical shapes that made me think about precise images and moments. So let's say that I've seen many things, but mainly shapes, and those shapes triggered glimpses of precise images in my mind. Mainly simple geometric shapes and lines, with the lines appearing to be a full rainbow spectrum (even though the lines were thin).  The lines tended to move around, sometimes more than one appearing at a time.  The shapes tended not to change-- just appeared in the middle of the screen for a second or two.  I did find, oddly, that I had some ability to conjure up the image of a particular (simple) shape if I pictured the shape first in my mind's eye for even just a moment.  Trippy.  :) Mainly spirals or circular shapes. Looked like a galaxy spinning or a roller coaster going around a track. Most things seemed to spin clockwise. mainly squares of color, and very faint geometric shapes Mainly what I saw resembled a blurry flashing circular checkerboard, with a dancing black crazing pattern overlayed. In the middle was a patch of cyan with a pattern like television snow. On the left I soon became aware of the garage of a house with a white light over the door, like what would be seen when walking down a suburban street at night (which is exactly what I had been doing earlier in the evening). The garage faded in and out, but was relatively persistent through the experience. Majority was abstract: rotating lines on screen; rainbows moving across screen; patterns -similar to the bottom of a Birkenstock shoe; briefly saw an image of looking up at the night sky in a forest with silhouettes of tree tops to the periphery and the sky in the middle.  Mandala style shapes mandalas, formas geométricas, imagens se modificando Mandalas, snowflakes, geometric simetrical patterns Many colors constantly changing 
Random short lines everywhere like one inch sticks - shapes - all absent of color - white Many colours, constantly shifting patterns, somethings were static and almost hidden just out of reach. Many different colors, not only black and red. It begun with some green and then I think I saw several different colors except yellow. The experience was unpleasant at the beginning but it became more enjoyable once I begun to see the different colors.  Many flashing patterns in rapid succession such as diamonds at the centre of the screen and smaller diamonds in horizontal and vertical lines forming a cross over the screen. Also moving spiral patterns that grew and swirled across the screen from one side to the other.  Sometimes colours such as white or pale blue would become the dominant colour on the screen. Many letters/words like newspaper clippings or magazine cut outs whizzing by at multiple depths and several font sizes Many moving geometric shapes, triangles, patterned lines moving around, and it was as if I was traveling towards them, like falling through a geometric web. many shape jumping around all over the screen and many line like thunder from the storm Many shapes mostly cubes many small pyramids Many spinning wheels, spirals, a few faces, more than a few eyes, frisbee-like discs many thin lines that were recursive in nature. 3d manifolds that both rapidly shifted and morphed around, tunnels. spots of light (numerous) often of green or pink in color, akin to a visual snow of sorts.lots of checkered patterns outlining the manifolds. bright flashing of red on the periheriy of vision outside of the screen Marbles, balls, orbiting one another mathematical equations, horizon lines, geometrical shapes, black holes Matrix of square dots, Effect like blackhole, Effect like screen getting wider or smaller... Maybe a chubby baby face outline or a chipmunk head with cheeks full of nuts outline - earlier on I thought it was  like a bike  but covered by a red sheet - no clear lines but areas. Once I sad a zipper right in the middle of the screen but that and the bike went away when the lines came.  The lines were clear but what they were of was hard to figure out. -Me driving through a tunnel
-The surface of a river with strong currents
-A telephone pole that breaks down
-A sword in the ground  meh mermaids tail & also sphere's that would grow from the edges of each other almost planet-like in appearance.  mesoamerican pyramids, butterflies, my iris, the motion of blurry people dancing, tortoise Minute 1-2: mostly flashing, some swirling / tunnel / dark circles.

Minute 3-10: Fairly constant shapes or patterns including: Swirling, Circles, Tunnels, Rotation, Lines, Numbers, Letters, Static (white & blue), Bands / Checkerboard Patterns

Minute 3-10: More complex forms emerging periodically lasting ~1-6 seconds: Trees, Forest, Leaves, Grassy Hills (in color, green, blues, browns, yellow/white), Bicycle wheel, wheels, entire bicycles being ridden by humans (humans not very distinct, bicycles were clear like the trees above) Mixed red and black colors that sometimes seemed to move from top to bottom  Mm Monkeys, cities drawn in a simple style with people with trees walking their dogs, at one point the whole screen opened up to a starry sky i was flying through and then became an incomprehensible mass of flowers and other household objects"

Most often there is a sphere in the center, with swirls. The best analog I can think of is the rising sun flag of japan, but rotating so that the stripes bend. Sometimes the sphere would have 2 stripes, and would resemble a neutron star as depicted in the game, Elite: Dangerous. This is occasionally morphed into a ""Doctor Who"" opening credits like tunnel, with occasional cross hatch patterns that resemble morphing plaid. The plaid pattern would morph into dozens of evenly spaced buzz saw like stars, (These were very detailed down to the saw tooth edges) and then into peacock eyes. At several points curved lines would appear and sometimes overlap and straighten to form a triangle and then appear 3 dimensional like a pyramid. Sometimes these lines would curve again and resemble rotating DNA stands. If this questionnaire allows for it on the next page, I have a condition, as well as some possible insight, that may be pertinent to this research that I would like to explain. If not I am open to questions Novaseta@gmail.com Mostly a red box with a gray center.  My eyes concern me now. Mostly a sense of movement alternating between going into a tunnel and then zooming back out, within different environments, sometimes more tunnel-like with a small square of white light in the center, sometimes more like traveling through a web of neurons mostly a spider web of lines that looked like a broken tiled floor Mostly abstract forms, a lot interwoven patterns, patterns, with a lot of movement and adaptation. Almost like a pulsating convolutional neural network that extrapolates from image to image, but the forms were often screen wide.  Sometimes it was like watching many galaxies rotating around each other, that would spin too fast, eject their mass forming wisps, and more abstract forms. Sometimes regular and symmetrical patterns would form, but often evolved into asymmetric and abstractions.  Mostly angular geometric patterns such as triangles and stars. Occasionally, hints of more complex scenes: ripples of water over a pond, an eye opening. Mostly black balls moving around a red screen. They moved with my eyes. Mostly blurred geometric shapes and lines, but also incomplex drawings of a fish and a stick figure. Sometimes there were very small, clear points and lines which were bright-white and looked like some kind of lasers.  Mostly bright lightening strings or whips and an overall pattern like flower petals  Mostly colors and circles of light balls rotating, also an eye opening, at the end. Mostly colors, orange, yellow, white. The screen would seem to morph and change shape (like it was moving downward, and compressing like an accordion (little bit, nothing major))  Mostly complex and somewhat cosmic geometrical shapes, and occasionally short scenes with people. Everything i saw was moving in some way Mostly complex machines with spinning wheels, and galaxies and spinning tops, then supersonic flight over a landscape, grass in the foreground parting to series of hills shooting past as I flew banking left then right, a ballerina dancing, a large deep sea fish with a huge mouth biting, a skull, rotating and moving. A lot of patterns of diagonal and vertical crosses and intersecting lines, always moving across the screen. I felt an element of being able to interact with and control what I was seeing almost like a lucid dream at times. It was really beautiful and often quite breathtaking. It was mostly monochrome shades but with some occasional yellows and oranges.  mostly cross hatches. some vague images, almost like a shadow or inkblot of a large butterfly and a large bird head with moving beak. little ball of white light in centre at one point towards mid/end - only for a few seconds. mostly diamonds and cross shapes, but sometimes snaking lines and orbs that seemed to be on fire Mostly diamonds, triangles. These shapes were rotating counter clockwise iirc.  Mostly distortions. At times the black seemed more like blue. Seemed my imagination sometimes merged with the flicker, I think I saw three skeletal faces looking at me for a few moments. Sometimes a kind of tunnel towards which I was falling appeared, I could guide it a bit by looking around the screen, but it would dissipate if I looked around too fast. Mostly evolving patterns of grids, and spinning patterns oriented around a center. Colours other than black and red were mostly white ish. Nothing seemed to form which resembled worldly objects, though some of the grids and the way they evolved reminded me of the scenes in Star Wars where rebel aircraft were flying fast and close to the surface of the death star, i.e. walls passing near to the viewer at speed. Mostly fractal like geometry usually, but not always radiating out from the center. Sometimes the fractals would create snake like shapes that would divide and recombine. Sometimes the fractals seemed to move as if going down a tube. Sometimes the center of the fractal would become a fan of laser-like light tracking my eye movements. The sparkles mentioned above were Inter because they were the only objects that were not red or black and they seemed to have a vivid shimmer. They stars were also tightly packed at first, but spread out and moved if I wanted them to, though my control was limited.  Mostly Geometric patterns, triangles and circles and squiggly parallel lines and they blended in and out of each other and morphed around.
I only used it for about one or two minutes, as it wasn't all too entertaining and the white noise was very unpleasant. It made me feel unwell, I think. The flickering screen was fine, although I should add the majority of imagery was located within the screen, might have something to do with the lights being on. Saw some other more complex forms every now and then, but it wasn't all too vivid. Mostly geometric shapes and patterns in constant motion. There was a heavy theme of moving stripes (red and black). A good example is the image of walking down a red and black striped hallway. Sometimes more complex structures like buildings or spacecraft would appear. Also, there would sometimes be an underlying spinning, sometimes clockwise sometimes counter clockwise. Mostly geometric shapes morphing like a Mandelbrot set. Mostly geometric shapes. Spinning wheels of brighter light with dark shading. Images like moving through a tunnel, sometimes curving, but spiky. Balls that slowly rotated, made up of octagons but not completely formed or with unsealed edges. Mostly green sparkle pint turned into celestial views. Closing my eyes had an interesting effect. The halo of the screen was very similar to the sun with the eyes closed plus darting geometry.  Mostly green sparkle pint turned into celestial views. Closing my eyes had an interesting effect. The halo of the screen was very similar to the sun with the eyes closed plus darting geometry.  Mostly grids and points of lights Mostly grids, patterns, but also 3D shapes. Feeling of motion, like moving down a 3d hallway, moving towards something, and a lot of ""spinning"" effects, like a disc of diamond shapes, made up of many rings, all spinning in opposite directions. Mostly hexagon type shapes spinning Mostly I saw a bunch of red lights battling each other: whipping by in swirls, smacking into white balls of light, flashing out like fans of lasers. I saw a lot of spinning fractal images and patterns, like through a kaleidoscope (they were mostly red, white, and blue). Early on the fractals were entirely line and shape patterns, but towards the end they developed complex and vivid textures like bubbles and feathers and honeycombs - it was more like looking at a painting as opposed to my computer screen, but it was isolated to a small corner. Sometimes there was a black-and-white animation on the edge of my vision, but it was moving too quickly for me to make out. I thought it looked like an old Mickey Mouse cartoon at one point. I also faintly saw Simpsons characters. Would you consider spinning galaxies complex environments? They didn't seem that exciting, because they were all in red and white. I saw a simple stick figure riding a bike, kicking a ball, things like that - the figure was blurry, definitely in there but not clear. Eventually, I saw a rainbow! There was more, but these are the things that stand out. Mostly I saw abstract shapes morphing into other abstract shapes. At the beginning, I did see what appeared to be an outline of a building. mostly I saw lines emerging from my focal point, creating a sunburst pattern; sometimes a full crosshatch covered the screen; and then at one point I saw a slow sine wave gently pass from right to left, just above my focal point; and at another moment I saw the screen pour away from me, down into the computer screen mostly I saw nothing, but there was a bit of a white spiderweb spindle that would sometimes weave around. I did not watch for the full time! Mostly images of shapes which seemed to move, grow and change Mostly images resembling fractals but only in shades of red and black Mostly indistinct lines, curves, and blobs. For the last few minutes there was a static flame pattern along the bottom periphery, and a flashing, blurry line down the middle from top to bottom. Most remarkable was actually when I turned the flicker off: for a few seconds, I saw very clear swirls on the whole screen (the dark gray background of the page that played the white noise), all about the size of a half-dollar, swirling in and out of each other. These were much more clear and fluid than anything I saw during the Ganzflicker. This effect persisted for just a few seconds. Mostly intense flashes of ge9metric shapes ... some green color spots like stars Mostly it was a constant array of different colors.  After the first minute the screen was constantly shifting through different colors, but not like the entire screen would be the same, but in each moment it looked like the screen was made up of different patches of colors all over it.  

Towards the final minutes it started to look like lines were approaching me, like highway lines, with maybe a tunnel around them.  It was faint though, like the shapes were there, but the colors were still changing around them.  So more like I could see the outline of a road as though I was driving down it.  Maybe like an engraving more than an outline. Mostly it was diagonal, horizontal and vertical lines sometimes stationary sometimes martching across the screen like an old tv on a bad station. Ocasionaly they'd form into blocks in the center and on the sides. Sometimes the blinking would appear to speed up or slow down. Mostly it was moving geometric shapes, but I also saw a large black spider crawl across the screen (an artistic rendering of a spider, not realistic), a dark blue pond with yellow-green lily pads,  a lunging creature with large claws, and a spinning globe, bright blue with green continents. Also in my peripheral vision it looked like grey mold or frost was growing around the outside of the screen, beginning to creep onto the screen but never getting further, and disappearing as soon as I looked directly at it. Mostly just a constantly rotating camera view of large fuzzy shapes & landscapes. Felt like under water or in outer space. Occasionally ""saw"" a large structure, kind of like a space station from star trek deep space nine, but it was never really vivid. I mostly saw outlines of the shapes, sometimes formed by lines of bright dots. Mostly just a general movement. Sometimes a connected movement - example a circle repeating itself in an arch. I saw a general face. Little tiny specks of blueish. Like tiny dashes shooting across the screen. Yellow popped up on the periphery. An hour glass. Snake-like shapes  Mostly just moving geometric patterns, sometimes blocky, sometimes wavy.  Mostly just shapes and patterns, but occasionally imagery that wasn’t realistic but reminded me of scenery like spinning in outer space, Ferris wheels, countryside through a car window, zooming down a long hallway, etc. Mostly just the Windmill. But at first it felt like the red had depth like it was a room I could reach my hand into. Mostly landscapes, abstract with a sci-fi atmosphere, & sequences of moving through long winding tunnels that looked like they could be part of a huge spaceship in a sci-fi movie. Sometimes it was like flying through a violent storm. A few sequences of pulsating, concentric rings emanating from a large eye. Later it turned more organic, & I felt like I was moving through the intestinal passages of some huge creature. There was a sense of movement throughout. Towards the end, a series of distorted clown-like faces appeared. At times the screen appeared almost entirely blue with arcs of white light. Vivid prismatic colors emerged about half-way through & slowly intensified until the end. Mostly like light / colored beams beams bouncing back n forth from left to right. Like a tennis ball volleys, in a continuous beam Mostly lines and crystalline structures without a distinct shape Mostly morphing shapes. Some took on the image of shimmering wreathes or snakes Mostly nothing, occasionally it felt like I was going through a wormhole, or I'd see some simple spinning lines, or a spinning 2d plane in 3d space. Mostly patterns Submerging into landscapes after like 6 minutes Mostly patterns that morphed into an oscillation in the center, up and down at first, then side to side, and then every direction. Everything was pretty symmetrical but after awhile the patterns and oscillations would change randomly and become less symmetric and swirls were happening too. At one point it didn't seem like the patterns were changing and then it quickly changed into a fast swirl like water down a drain and I had a feeling in my stomach like going down the first drop in a roller coaster. This was unexpected but my mind quickly snapped back to control. After that the patterns and swirls became somewhat simple. Mostly radial symmetry, generally 6- or 8-fold patterns of lines, centered on the middle of the screen. As it went on the center point shifted around and I perceived more sweeping lines at angles moving across the screen. mostly random figures and a pyramid Mostly random geometric patterns and flashes, sometimes lines travelling across the screen, sometimes like a cityscape or scenery silhouette briefly and insubstantially. A few more vivid mental pictures of animal faces or body movements, but very very fleeting. Mostly red and black, with some green cell-like structures in the middle that appeared and faded recurrently  Mostly red background with small lime green triangles, pale blue speckles and black scratch marks. A dark teal  shadow morphed over the whole thing.  Sometimes in blobs, sometimes a butterfly kind of shape.   Mostly rotating Xes and after a while also circles. Sometimes rotating squares and lines. The colours sometimes changed to white instead of red and dark blue instead of black, especially near the corners of my vision. Whatever shape I saw, they were always moving around and usually rotating counter-clockwise. I also saw some black spots but very rarely and only towards the end, of which one looked like the character Baymax from a side view. That was the only one of which I could identify the shape. Mostly round shapes, sometimes just one at the center of the gaze, sometimes lots all over the screen. The mostly rotated, mostly counterclockwise. I was able to see them rotate clockwise if I thought about it. Some of them where long, tendril like, reminding me of fractals, some just ""spots"", and some starbursts.

Primarily they seemed to be red and blue, but dark blue. When my eyes were partially closed (like a blink), the movement sped up quite a bit (like 5-10 times as fast).

After exiting the Ganzflicker screen I could see several ""trails"" of my mouse, and changing windows seemed to stutter, as if I could see the refresh rate of the monitor. This faded after about 30 seconds mostly saw grids, like a chessboard. saw spiderwebs and something like the shape of a spider. thought i also saw a human shape or the outline of a person at the very start. some circular shapes as well Mostly saw moving (spinning, going back and forth, etc.) complex geometric patterns that reminds me of energy/electricity. Saw some dancing figures at one point and other human figures (outlines). I was able to make the patterns change direction at will when I tried. The screen also seemed to move around. Mostly saw pyramids from different angles. And geometric shapes within geometric shapes. Occasionally saw flowers and a forest landscape. I could tell what everything was but there were no details. The screen also seemed to move away from me.  mostly shapes and balls moving, a persistent image was like moving through a tunnel with lights moving in 1) top right to bottom left and 2) top left to bottom right, sometimes in an X formation like seeing both tunnel movements at the same time. several times the monitor seemed to bow in and out but nothing like it was coming to life or anything. Mostly shapes and on my 2nd attempt I saw a glimpse of a cyclinder shaped building but when I focused on it it disappeared while I couldnt see much after noticeable besides patterns I did sense that what my brain was trying to make was a city Mostly shapes like spider webs. Or some filaments raising from the center. 
I also saw some lights other than red and black.  Mostly green specks.  Mostly shapes, some letters Mostly shapes; rectangles, squares. Sometimes the screen would split into two, sometimes it seemed like light was exploding out from the screen in a halo or in flashes. Occassionally there were wavy lines through the center of the screen, or tiny balls/flashes of light. Mostly simple kaleidoscope shifting of shapes. Evolved into flickering images of mythic or fantasy creatures. I do shamanic journey work and tried to do that here. It kind of worked but not as well as I've liked. Mostly simple shapes. Aside from what was described above, I saw inverted pyramid or a ""V,"" the black nearly entirely disappeared to red, but would occasionally appear to be blue. A grid of sorts would form at times with the same pattern in each square. Images would spin faster the further I tilted my head Mostly so so many colors. I don't know what color was flashing on the screen anymore.
Flashing was in an X or V shape in front of eyes as if a strong light is moving back and forth in this shape. May be it was screen refresh going down. I have good dual monitors.
I went in expecting hallucinations as others have described but didn't.
Kept hearing some faint music in that noise throughout. mostly spiderwebs, sometimes there would be 'lightning arc' shaped strips that were across the screen and would flow/undulate around like a sea creature. mostly crossing the center of the screen but rotating randomly.
thought i saw the arms and chest of a person almost skeletal/stick figurey moving their arms about for a little.
I watched for ~9 minutes. wasnt sure how long i was watching but when i decided to stop since i didnt feel i was seeing much i saw it was like 8:50ish. mins into the white noise. mostly spinning gears and flying out of world technology planes, futuristic buildings and anything else about futuristic sci-fi scenes Mostly spinning lines and rotating shapes with occasional lightening flashes of white yellow and/or green. There were occasional almost complex objects, like a face or human figure, but very vague (like seeing Jesus in your toast, it kinda only looked like a face if I wanted it to). The spins almost had a pattern that depended on my focus - at the beginning when I was focusing my eyes a bit in the center there was a curve on each side and the ripples were making shapes and curves in the middle, and as my eyes unfocused they moved and focused a bit more on the right (my left eye is a bit lazy). mostly spirals mostly spots, thick lines that were horizontal, vertical or diagonal (diagonal-of to peripheral), small spots of different blue and purple (like noise)  Mostly square and diamond shaped patterns, but occasionally the pattern were rainbows, both curved and multicolored mostly standard types of lines and balls you would expect from optical illusion images (i.e. false lines and balls).  there was maybe one or two moments where I imagined people our maybe ghost faces but it was maybe 0.5sec in time and only happened once and wasn't scary.  for complete disclosure I felt i was zoning out towards the end as it got boring and i was imagining things in my mind related to things I experienced during the day and what people said rather than ""watching"" the screen (even though I was actually watching the screen the whole time). Mostly straight lines as if viewing a mass of large crystals, some circular images like oversized fingerprints.  Mostly symetrical patterns of circles. Like two semicircles made of spheres, one at each side of the screen and spinning fast. It would restart each time I blinked, taking about 3 seconds to restart. Mostly the long hallways. Outer edges in black and it appeared to be longer and further away the longer I stared. Planning to do this later with white noise in the dark.  Mostly they looked like very simple drawn stars. Just made out of simple strokes. They appeared all over my monitor with some distance to each other. Each star had 3cm in diameter. In total there were like one dozen of them. My monitor has 24 inch. I'm sitting 40cm away from it.
Once there was a bit more complex image with more and smaller stars in my foveal sight. The appearance was more like looking up to the night sky. However, none of the images were really clear. Instead, it was like a transparent filter above the red and black flicker. mostly this weird tunnel sort of distortion made of red and black squares Mostly trapezoid and rhombus shapes  mostly traveling down hallways and tunnels. moving closer to the screen i momentarily perceived three dimensional walls at the edges of the screen like the ganzflicker was happening inside a room. some geometric shapes like honeycombs with bubbles swirling between them, some pinwheels that took up the whole screen Mostly tunnels of overarching colored lights, mainly blue, violet, yellow, with a spot of yellow at the end of the tunnel and rays of light coming out of the tunnel. mostly twirling and undulating geometric shapes and occasionally vague demonic black shapes almost subliminally.  Mostly vague patterns covering the whole screen, though sometimes with the edges more fuzzy. The patterns were more organic than straight-line. Mostly zig zags, vertical, and horizontal moving lines, as well as spinning.  I saw, red, orange, black and dark green. Mostly, I saw patterns of shapes in red and blue - on a grid, triangles from the center point of the screen, swirls, etc.  For a long time, on the right edge of the screen, I felt like I was seeing something like a large keyboard in a grayscale image, but it only occupied the rightmost 25% of the screen and was fleeting if I tried to look directly at it.  I imagined I could see that I was traveling thorugh  a tunnel at rapid speed at times. Motorcycle,bird,unexplainable geometries,rain,blue color Mountains in the distance with a forest and lake up front, a castle, blue fractals Movement imagery like spinning legs wearing cowboy boots, as if attached to a wheel. Train grills approaching. Different shapes, changing. Whole screen seemed to change size, getting bigger and smaller. Mostly black and orange, but one part had a lighter colour at the bottom in symmetrical shapes. Sometimes pulses of many colours, recall being reminded of a peacock's tail.  moving and color changing screen Moving balls; moving, vibrating bands of zebra-striped pattern; vague, human and horse-like faces in bright contrast; flashing splotches of white and blue; a dark vignette around the edge of the screen"

It gave the sensation of looking at movement. Moving dimensions, moving tunnels, moving shapes Moving distorted colorful city street life. Moving fractal/geometric patterns,similar to a kaleidoskop, mostly originating in the center of the screen moving outwards, close to the corners i saw usually just flickering. This gave it some threedimensionality, sometimes it looked like looking through the windshield of a fast vehicle moving through a weird red/blue patterned space, sometimes briefly like a window into an empty room with similar patterns.  Sometimes undefinable ""dull"" shapes of light, difficult to focus on, wavering around. Sometimes blurry lines or rings, mostly static. Moving geometric shapes with trails, lots of green color pops. For a moment there was a ferris wheel shaped moving geometry. Geometric green shapes from time to time. Moving geometric shapes, translucents comets, moving slowing from center to peripheral, changing shapes, and sizes as they progressed, almost like a starfield effect, after a few minutes, colors seemed to separate as well, into definitive black vs red vs a mixture of other colors. I found it difficult to focus and in some ways felt it made me go somewhat cross eyed/light headed moving landscapes, buildings, sahpes MOVING MANDELBROT LIKE PATTERNS moving on plains with scrub plants Moving patterns from right to left, like watching a carousel;  also patterns emerging from the center of the screen to the periphery (like watching  the horizon from moving vehicle). The patterns were simple - rows of keyhole shaped siluettes, etc  moving shapes that turned into moving landscapes and other images Moving shapes with rounded edges. No corners. Like moving water very fluid  moving shapes, lines, periphery colored rain, hands, large cat, empty room, corridors, bottom half of screen watching a cartoon person walk across a room/office, and music instruments; red, orange, blue white, green and black colors Moving spirals, and geometric shapes after a few minutes. Sometimes the black color looked blue Moving through tunnels of various shapes: triangle, circle, square tunnels. Moving along ribbons of circles. Blue and green fullscreen color phasing in and out of the red. Blackish animation of a highly detailed eye opening and closing from different angles. Fast/random flecks of black ""dust"" like on old cinema film reels. A single darkish spot near the center of my focus that moved in elliptical patterns around my field of view and subtly warped the effects (might have been centered on an eye floater, hard to say with the flicker going). Lines (might have been related to monitor refresh) moving yellow orbs, color spectrum across top of screen, clouds descending intermittently Much of what I saw was like I was in the front seat of a rollercoaster. I saw the track ahead of me and felt every turn and loop. Other times, I was flying over a vast ocean and watching the waves break. At least twice, I was driving through a long tunnel. At least once, I was flying in a spaceship through hyperspace, like a Star Wars pilot. Multiple blue crosses across the screen, followed by lots of tesselating shapes that spun in a clockwise direction, then the screen started turning blue but couldn't work out what any of the shapes were then went back to tesselating pattern but not spinning this time. Should note that the whole time, my brain was convinced that my computer was shaking. Multiple colored (blue, green) dots spinning, faint hints at tunnels morphing into spirals, narrow lines of ""TV static"" - contrasted lines with some shifting, regular patterns of darker and brighter red areas on periphery, something like mirrored waveform visualization, symmetrical from the bottom center of the screen, geometric figures trying to materialize and morphing into others or fading back into the background. Everything besides small dots was pretty faint. multiple colors, lines outlining objects that appeared to have random shapes Multiple colors. Radiating 360 degrees from a center were thin lines that occupied about 1/6 of the computer screen that seem to have shifted from white at first changing to black toward the end. Each line was a zig zag with a long radial line from center outward and then a short line at 90 degrees and then continues on as a long radial line away from the center. multple colors, squares, lines, dapples of colors, sheets of colors, undulations, 3 dimensional spacial openings/gates to ""inside"" of image (not circluar) my answer may null the entire response, but I closed my eyes during it, and the images became far more vivid, I could still see the light even though my eyes were closed with a dimmer flashing light, and it began with a grid mapping, and then mountains became to appear, but I wasnt at ground level, the whole experience wasn't from my perspective, but more of a world-builder view, it was very geometric at first but it moved like a movie, very fluid. and it got clearer the more I focused on the images My brain seemed to be searching for any intrinsic pattern in the flicker, so I ""saw"" sunbursts stemming from the center, ripples from one side to the other, changes in apparent brightness My destiny. HAHAHAHA. I saw my face turn into something not nice looking, kinda evil looking, kinda unsettling, yet, and this shouldn't surprise me or anyone, even evil hallucinogenic me is kinda got it going on. but creeped me the fuck out. My eyes kept watering, and the images disappeared when I blinked. This means a new image was created to replace the old one; these images were nothing too specific, just general shapes and repeating patterns. They were very enchanting and mesmerizing- the dots of bright color zoomed across the screen, and about half way in I had a sort of out of body experience.  My father My home village in the norwegian wood My phone started to warp after I looked at Ganzflicker for a few seconds. Then I started seeing some shapes in the screen but it was not consistent. Phone being warped continued until I closed it after looking at it for 6 minutes or so because my eyes were hurt. It felt weird my reflection moving on its own,
somebody behind me holding my shoulder,
eyes staring at me.
 My screen got wider and there was a grid like pattern on the screen.  needles, sun, blooming Neon lights shooting around, swirling and forming shapes and then unforming Never any shapes, pictures, etc. - just vivid colors other than red and black. Mostly purple, royal blue, and teal green, with a faint yellow halo at the screen edges. Most of the screen would change color, with much less change on the left side of the screen. The colors started within the first minute and continued constantly for another six or so minutes. Then less frequent, and in the last minute or two I saw no colors at all other than red and black. No distinct recognisable image. Just a white flashing pattern towards the centre of the screen. I felt that my noting to myself that it was happening always led to its disappearance No images, but a bit of blue and green tinges. Some feeling of rotation. no real images just changes of intensity. LIke waves with a center point that moved around.  not much Not much to say other than I saw constantly shifting patterns, sometimes geometric, others reminiscent of old 80's computer generated graphics Not much. I was really disappointed. Nothing changed for me except for the color black becoming blue at the two minute mark nothing happend few minutes, then screen started to warp into and rotate, at the same time some grain appeared at the left side outside of the border of the screen, and some circles appeared at the top border of the screen Nothing happened in first 1-2 minutes but an unpleasant noise. Then the red image started to enlarge, create some weird shapes and cover the frame, I mean I almost couldn't see the frame of my monitor. And as I got closer to the end, the red image started to enlarge with the frame of my monitor. But it just happened for a very little amount of time. I also want to declare that my eyes hurt increasingly as I got closer to the end. Nothing specific beyond expansion of visual field nothing, just when i turned off screen, i saw some zeross Nothing, then red lasers, then line drawings which is irregular but sometime it takes shape of insects, fruits, etc Objects occasional columns of small and connected green blobs Occasionally a circle would form in the middle of my visual field. It was flashing red & black as well, but more red than the area around it. I could make it appear in a different location by shifting the center of my focus to another part of the screen, but it had a tendency to float back towards the center of the screen. My best guess is that I was sensing the densely packed circle of neurons in center of my visual cortex. I say this because I have meditation experiences of generating a 'nimitta' (circle of white light appearing with deep concentration) and the indistinct red circle was the same size. Ocean looking lines  Oceans apes, planetscapes, building and my loved ones naked body Octagons Often it was a multicolor grid of orange and pink circles with electric green lines between them. I think there was a lot of yellow, too. But these shapes would sort of shift and change. Then, there was this black blob, sort of like a cloud, morphing and kind of coming out of the screen. I saw this black blob maybe three times through the whole experience.  Often it was patterns and shapes (diamonds, triangles, wavy lines, etc.) moving across the screen. Other times, it seemed to be like a spinning tunnel that I was moving through.  Often the screen felt as if it was expanding sideways, and there was a visual tearing effect, it felt like the screen was being pulled up. I saw blue and gray splotches that reminded me of trees and water and saw for only a second a blurry image of a naked woman. Otherwise just splotches of light and color.  Once i focused completely on the test it became a constantly changing lightshow, complex patterns that rotated and oscillated, bouncing up and down, and at one point i even felt like the screen was being rotated up and away from me.

To test something i held my hand in front of me and shook it, it appeared very blurry and i noticed that the flickering was no longer harsh red-black-red-black, but it smoothly faded in and out. When i closed my eyes i saw the inverse of the screen (black in middle, red in periphery) with a complex pattern laid on top. only changing colors and undefined shapes appeared to me Only saw red & black for a few seconds, then red and deep aqua with hints of orange, green & blue; blobs moving quickly, some times fanning out from points on the screen, but usually a fast back and forth motion up and down that would spin 45° left and right, rarely going horizontal, breaking up then reforming. No shapes, just rapidly changing color blobs and streaks. Only saw red and yellow flashes that gave me a headache Only saw some green, blue and orange colors ripple on the screen. Only some green dots here and there. Maybe about 10 dots at a time. Open spaces, castles in the sky orange and petrolblue kind of squares coming fro the center going outside, sometimes band of re at bottom and band of petrol on topm everything ozilating Orange Color, yellow dots flickering, fractals, tiled floors, forest orange flicker
 Orange pink. Blue crystal lines like frost orange screen , purple screen , yellow screen , green screen , purple flowers middle of orange screen , purple waves middle of yellow screen , screen warping , everything of above with blinkings full black screen Orbs, webs. Happened to close my eyes briefly during the experience and saw fractal-like images Örümcek gibi bir sey vardı  Oscillating central band with dancing flames on the edge like the burner of a stove. oscillating horizontal lines, not black at all, but mostly green, less red Other colors, moving patterns like large birds flying across the screen Other than a very few random lines or shapes all around, a few times it looked like I was going through a tunnel at some kind of hyperspeed.  On either side of center (not up or down, just left or right) was a long stream of a row of squares that were similar to how the tunnel would look if it were made up of endless windows.  No other colors but varying intensities of the red. Outline of people Outline of thinking face, insects, butterflies, hearts Outlines of hearts, all lined up perfectly in a row. Flickering moving lines, like on an old TV. Overlapping circles, balls of light, random lines,  Palm tree jungle, a spinning saw blade and a tall rectangular building with a ball shape on top of it. Panther head that exploded into multiple creatures running away. Two people fighting like they were in an anime. Starship flying in space parts of the screen felt like they were rotating and growing/shrinking. I saw many balls. Also bars that very quickly oscillated back and forth. At some point something like a book, very faint. Passing blurred rectangles. Constant. Patches of leaves like ivy in blues and green patches of yellow and blue, and lines/dots forming a tunnel toward fixation pattern of dark blue triangles with a wide blue-azure border Patterns Patterns in the central image, but at first it was unpleasant then it started being pleasant.  Patterns like stripes on a flag or a brick wall. I also say shapes in certain positions like looking at a building on a map patterns like you'd see in a kaleidoscope, raindrops on water, like riding a space ship through stars and galaxies that pass by too quickly to make out details , the color blue Patterns morphing in and out as in a kaleidoscope appeared immediately. After awhile (not sure how long), a kind of tunnel opened in the center with a collection of small white figures, as if distant or far away. It was all still very graphic, red/white/black, not highly detailed or realistic. At times there was a rainbow moving around the screen, and later it seemed the blonde head of a woman resting on a pillow that moved around the screen and out of it. patterns moving away, toward me, spirals.  I could choose which to see. Patterns of black overpowering red and visa versa Patterns of black, red, blue. Tunnel, grid, diagonal straight lines  patterns of colors, dots, waves of light Patterns of false motion, vaguely similar to various optical illusions Patterns of geometric forms Patterns of geometric, constantly changing shapes that pulsated throughout the screen Patterns resembling sun rays, waves on water, sensations of the screen getting closer/farther away, or the flickering getting faster/slower. patterns rotating and moving toward and away from me Patterns rotating counter clockwise with math-like writing swirling with it. Patterns that depended on where I was focusing my gaze."

Patterns, geometric shapes, tunnels, grids Patterns, mostly geometric shapes. At one point it looked like there were red, green, and yellow waves (like a visual of a sound wave) crashing around the screen Patterns, originating in center and corners of the screen.  Buildings, People, Astronomical objects, Eyes, Faces, Horizons/Landscapes, Conflict, Struggle, Survival. Patterns: at first reminded me of a bed of dry tree leaves, with distinct edges and veining, though it was only around the edges of the screen, not in the middle; then cloudy white and dark blue puffs that resembled leopard markings; then lines/dotted lines of light that mostly rotated counter-clockwise but moved around the screen vertically and horizontally.  Patters of lines what csme to mind was similar to cracks in glass morphing into a pattern of “cells” layered upon themselves then turning to into what i can only describe as a Jackson Pollock painting. All this occurring underneath the flashing colors of the screen, really cool and trippy. Peace sign, cross, shooting star, galaxy people standing, dancing (cocktail party atmosphere) People, a city, my cat, myself Periods where blue, then orange, colors dominated, lines appeared and disappeared Phoenix,Purple,Eyes pile of golden objects in the left upper portion of the screen, shifting to a centered rainbow circle with diagonal rays shooting out to the corners of the screen. and finally a bunch of small 1"" square ""windows"" looking through silhouettes of trees into a lake (this last was the less vivid imagery but still notable) Pink yellow and green lines moving past me like moving through a tunnel. Glimpses of mountains. Vague human body shapes. Moving blobs. Large vague shadows. Pinwheel type effect, a line rotating clockwise for a while, counterclockwise for a while Playing baseball, a man's face he seemed evil, a house on the edge of a town and someone laying down.  Please pointed stone arches passing one after the other poka dots on a dress or on a landscape with brownish purplish colour well defined Primarily a large X covering the whole screen with a slight vertical line primitive people around a campfire, spiders with big eyes, a country scene around autumn with bats with big eyes, a summer scene at the beach with dune foliage blowing in the wind, red and black, blue and green, stars. Prominent cross, blurry text, spheres, spiral pulling me in pulsating squares overlapping morphed into spiraling pulses that spun rapidly around and a long bird flapping its wings was in the center of my view and then I stopped because I was getting a headache pulsation that started turning into lines, spirals, balls and trajectories Pulses of morphing objects and colors of all variety pulses, like drops on water. spiral motion, first clockwise, then counter clockwise, spot with radial beams, sometime 4, 5 or 8 Pulsing hexagonal fractal, white sound waveform, a scratched film-grain texture, an amorphous shape sliding around the screen of a indescribable color.  pulsing red, dark blue, and yellow blobs; pale lines (grids, spiderwebs); propellers spinning this way and then that turning into wreaths of fish also spinning, then daisy flowers spinning; pale line drawings superimposed on each other and morphing, every possible thing and person from cups to hats to faces; saw nothing ""real"" or fully fleshed; color blobs underlaid it all, constantly; spinning wheels and propellers constant. pulsing shapes, middle cube morphed into golden line which moved around the screen, rotating the remaining of cube pulsing squares and zig zagging patterns going vertically and diagonally Pyramid of Giza not just a triangle. The sun and space. A tunnel and roads with curves. A hooded figure. Film. Random shapes. Pyramid. Cross in the center dividing the screen into 4 segments. bright blue and white center with lines coming out in the 4 directions. Then that would spin and change. The white center could then be a comet moving up and down then off the screen tho the left. lots of stuff moved to the left. Grid patterns. Arrows pointing right but moving left like >>>> but filled the whole screen. some building like structures but would fade quickly going back to geometric shapes. Some shapes and movement had a three dimensional effect. Quick spinning circles resembled fluid flow I saw the most. I saw flashing striped lines. I saw yellow and green and orange. Two different textures, one under the other, moving in different directions. Raging red flickers of fire. Like seeing shapes and creating stories looking at a camp fire. Rainbow Rainbow (noted above). Also lines. Not sure oh what. The rainbow was the most notable thing. Also a sense of pixels… like that I could see the pixels, in the display actually changing. Rainbow (noted above). Also lines. Not sure oh what. The rainbow was the most notable thing. Also a sense of pixels… like that I could see the pixels, in the display actually changing. rainbow circles going round, golden spiral, waves, repeating faces & bodies, a lighthouse, an island, a beach, beetle which took up the whole screen, hearts, chakras orbs, stars, going forward on train tracks in a train, tunnels, single eye, several eyes, simple geometric patterns, and complex patterns Rainbow lines rotating as if it were a yo yo being spun by the string rainbow lines, shapes, streets, outer space with stars, the planets, vivid green and blue,  Rainbow of colors and objects that were outlined in rainbow color Rainbow of colors, it seemed like the colors would change into shapes.  The flash seemed to slowdown and then speed up rainbow rays, distorted faces like Picasso's paints, roads, traveling alon the roads, some animal faces like gorilla and bear, rainbow fractals,. rainbow shapes and patterns, images of the earth and stars, and especially circularly rotating patterns of dots, all of which suggested shapes of galaxies, the earth and stars, and fish or birds flying about. Almost every shape or image I saw was in motion, hardly ever was it still Rainbow spirals and diagonal lines rainbow-colored whirlwind Random assortments of shapes, geometric shapes, faces, I swear to God at one point I saw very vividly the window that's behind me and the tree in my yard, moving silhouettes of people that would turn and move as if in a old movie where you can see each frame of the movie change to the next, one was a silhouette of what looked like a man in a noir style detective outfit with his trench coat and silhouettes of leaves blowing in the wind from the fan in my room. He was looking down and turned to face towards me before turning the other way and fading away into the next image, I think at one point there was a fine china mug that I saw Random geometric and abstract shapes of yellow zooming around and joining frequently in rotating circles and funnels. Many times I could manipulate the direction of the rotation. Saw pulsing lights. Might have been dark blue.  Random geometric shapes random items - tools, containers random lines and tunnels  Random massive blocks of rotating geometry, kind of like a honeycomb cells that made me feel ill at first. But I couldn't really make anything out and first and it just felt really uneasy.  

But then I figured out you can kind of control it by putting forms on it. I used the idea of a double helix and it gave a very serene effect. It was an incredible experience. It was as simple as thinking ""helix"" and the sense and image of one would emerge from the chaos and appear in it. I lost track of time just playing around, both seeing what I could project onto it but also experience from it in return.

It's an incredible experience. I haven't taken anything else tonight except for a coffee about an hour ago. Random rolling of red waves in no discernible pattern at the end.  Random shapes and patterns in a range of colors. Greens, blues, purple, white, red, black. Random shapes, monstrous creatures, faces, insects, owls, the moon, galaxies, large sailing ships on the ocean Random shapes, sometimes images that had partial shapes/feelings of shapes Random shapes; the ""flow"" of the flicker seemed to change. Sometimes I'd see a line of licker run across the bottom of the screen from left to right, or right to left, then see it coming from both the right side and the left side and culminating at the center; saw what seemed to be the whole screen sort of spinning or revolving around the center point; subtly, not vividly. Random square-like geometric shapes and patterns in the pulses.  Rapid heart beat in the very center with a fast moving train speeding across the screen in front of the heart. Almost like at a train station and the heart is on the opposite platform.  Rapidly changing multicolored geometric patterns that swirled, rotated, expanded/contracted, darted, or oozed Rapidly changing shape patterns and movements rapidly moving points of light that moved in diagonal directions primarily like as if someone were swinging a laser pointer back and forth as fast as possible. Those morphed into shapes that seemed to be gears meshing together, but in several layers, all moving in sync with each other. Various almost honeycombed patterns, but with rounded off corners. A bright center light with rays of light radiating out from the center like sunlight.  Rapidly spinning spiral galaxies and movement backwards and forwards through tunnels.  Astroid fields, crystals growing rapidly like frost. rectanglular shapes and circles and a dotted screen red and black Red and black blinking fast, maybe a center circle for a few seconds at a time. A little annoying after a while.  Red and black changed to red and blue after 1 minutes. After 3 minutes the colors began oscillating from side to side. After 5 minutes a full spectrum of colors was flashing in a picture like manner. After 7 minutes these colors began to take on a scene-like appearance. But these never became clear, only vague. Around the 10 minute mark bright flashes started intersplicing with the vague, color washed, scene-like pictures and that is where I closed the video. red and black flashes of course, the frequency seemed to change quite a bit.  Besides a ""checkerboard"" I saw a center focused pulsing of color and indefinable shapes. red and black flashes, I can see a line shape, like the blades of a fan constantly rotating. sometimes, the shape changes to a somewhat abstract shape, but still rotates clockwise. I also happen to turn my fan on at the time if that matters red and black line appear Red and blue skew above and below the screen
flickering square tiles smooth like bubbles
rotating simple kaleidoscope patterns with dull, faint rainbow color
1-2 bright lines across the screen, straight and rotating or spinning like a galaxy, sometimes with bright yellow and pink ""TV static"" inside
all visuals would be disrupted by blinking Red and yellow diagonal lines rounded tip  Red background changing to blueish/purple. Constant strobing effect making background color change with each strobe..White numbers and letters flashing briefly and moving from left to right.green trees in a skyline changing to buildings appeared complex yet pale ghostlike and drifting from top right to lower right the left to top left corner. I closed my eyes when I was finished and saw the most amazing turquoise.and purple square geometric shape the colors were mixing and swirling and somehow coming back to a multi circles inside the square (like a tv screen!) best part of the ganzflicker.  red black and white colors , screen warping red black flicker with images in line center  red black gray purple Red flashing with various blackish smudges flashing. red green and blue 3d grid Red Hearts , red circles , green circles, pebble like pattern Red light red lightning flashes, green flashes, darkening of outer edges of screen, feeling the screen was slowly moving towards me Red mostly flashing with dark, not appearing wholly black though. Faint thick lines or oblong shapes with irregular top or bottom edges like a wedge appeared infrequently. Red overall with some greenish/dark patches Red squares rotating, blue diamond shapes interlaced with red shapes, yellow here and there, text in the middle, images rotating in circles around the center, or in the center but never both, rectangles... red swirl in the middle and a big x in the middle of the screen. red zones,darkest zones, moving area, moving TV in the room as weel as other objects Red, black and blue randomness Red, black,yellow, orange. Green when I blinked. Sun in the middle, screen warping,lines radiating from center Red, blue, sometimes yellow, green laser lightshow. Sometimes swirling, often with strong lines that would stay for a few seconds and then morph into a new pattern Red, white, & Black at alternating speeds red. green blue flashes Red-black checkerboards and other symmetric patterns (both geometric and rotational), occasional diagonals of neon pink. Boundaries between colors, importantly, seemed artifacted, as though I was viewing a zoomed-in low-res JPEG. I suspect it was my brain beginning to get irritated at not being able to pin said boundaries down. Reddish - orange flashing screen. The flashing varied in speed, but it seemed to be on a cyclic pattern. I could not tell how long the pattern was before it looped. I saw a series of black dots on the top and bottom of the screen, which disappeared when I looked straight at them, like they only affected my blind spots. Reds and blacks, yes, and spinning. I saw blobs of white that would spray in the same space near the top of the shallow box I was looking into (the monitor) Remember seeing lots darker colors and lines crossing each other. Then the screen started to blink faster. Reminded me of the pattern on a common turtle's back. Repeating patterns. Mainly a plus + sign type geometry with four areas moving symmetrically. Then oval cloud like fields with lights flowing in between. Also swirling white and blue streaks. Was waiting for more.  Repeating shapes presented at the same interval. revolving vortexes that followed where I focused my field of vision Rings that expanded from the center outwards, eye like shape, dancing V shape across entire screen. ripples like a water droplet, colors other than red, a galaxy of stars"

Rotating geometric patterns, like the interference patterns of two or more patterns rapidly rotating and pulsing at different rates and/or directions. They would blur into indistinct black blobs and then grow more sharp and intricate patterns and then back again over the course of a few seconds. At first they always radiated from the center of the screen, but over time as my eyes relaxed it started moving to other parts. Sometimes to the corners, sometimes it'd switch from rotating to moving left to right or right to left. Occasionally it would appear the screen would shrink a few inches and then grow back to larger than the original size over a few second intervals. Rotating geometric primitives, mostly straight lines but sometimes curves and some squiggly textures rotating interconnecting disks, rapidly spinning circles, disks, and similarly curved shapes. (sorta like the way that black holes and galaxies are depicted)  rotating lights and thunders, an uterus that was springing like a fountain, a group of people I couldn't recognize, but I felt their physical presence beside and behind me Rotating rings seen from the side at first, then balls appeared moving sideways and around. Multiple rings in one another, moving in opposite directions. Texture, fuzziness, fire. The whole thing started spinning, and it looked as if I was moving through it, or zooming in. Colours, first of course green, then blue, yellow. Triangles moving like arrows, stacked on eachother. After turning on the lights around me fully, these arrow chains turned into dragons, flying around freely, horned and clearly textured with scales. It clearly helps to have no visual distractions at all. After that, the most random things would show up only briefly, like ghostly figures that I could often not see much further detail in. A walking figure, trees, biking figure, a cliffside, animals. rotating swirls, chaos patterns, holes sucking me in Rotating triangles, rotating sticks, rotating galaxies, rotating ""wormholes"", the shapes of letters (A,B,C,D,E,F) wich I could freely chose, a tree from its trunk seen from its base, parabolas, distorted face. Rotating, spinning geometric shapes. Primary colors as well as tans. rotations, wormholes, shapes, patterns. circles, squares, crosses etc. no images of animals or specific shapes per say but i only watched 5 min. some were very intense then my eyes would occasionally refocus and distract me Round oval blurry shapes Round stacked rocks around a well rows of graphs, or of circles/triangles. spiky city skylines, sunbursts Rqys of different colored light starting on the left side and then spreading across the screen.  At times,the light would extend beyond the screen. 

 Same images when you rub your eyes and push the blood out of them Saw a cross in the middle of the screen, diagonal lines flying across the screen from top to bottom, spinning rings, flashes of blue and green, and columns on the top and the bottom of the screen saw a forest, treetops from the forest floor. A cloudy horizon on the clear ocean. saw a girls face metallic objects like screws and forests and characters that look like anime drawn appear Saw bodies and figures and faces.  Saw bouncing balls and old time TV snow patterns. And also like rushing down a spinning tunnel. And lots of bouncing wave patterns  saw fractals, geometric shapes. they would move but it was somewhat temporary. i felt like my thought in general would get in the way. maybe people who are mentally okay without anxiety are better at it cuz they can focus. idk  saw fractally what seemed like fish shapes swimming, but its not like a actual fish you know what i mean?  fractally looking millipeeds? crawling.  ive tripped many times before and it reminded me of when i would look at textured ground and see mandalas and floral patterns in them. but not to the same extent, like not as intense  saw galaxies moving and clashing with each other, saw black holes swallowing their surroundings, saw planets as viewed from space, saw constellation patterns Saw how psychologists use nonsense tests to try to reduce the complexities of existence to self serving (and grant granting) conclusions. Are you sure you're totally sane?  saw lots of colors/patterns and my own reflection saw lots of rotating fractals. very strange Saw lots of spirals moving and flipping over each other - made of dots - like planets and spinning solar systems, in teal blues and yellows in addition to red and black, and some white.  saw old stone buildings, first a small square room spinning and then i was outside of the room and the building was spinning, later i started seeing like the outside of the bulding (it was like it was a castle?) there were some stone columns and all was blue-ish stone, someone was standing looking at me but it was just a shadow, i was flying above it so the person was small and i couldnt see anything  Saw palm trees blowing, mountains, people Saw shapes like triangles, the faint outline of an eye and a rabbit like animal. I had the feeling that I could see into another room like someone staring back through the computer. Feeling of being inside a super fast train, so fast that the light coming in through the windows were flashes.  saw shapes like Xs and balls, sometimes almost looking like a wormhole but not a very strong effect (nto to disimalar to rubbing my eyes with my eyes closed) Saw shell patterns and lines with triangles on the side Saw some green when I went from fullscreen to smaller screen
Fovea/focus region seemed to be brighter red than the rest
Some bright lines which would move around
For a period of time the image seemed to be pulsing towards me and away from me (perpendicular to my screen)
Some geometric shapes which moved around and sometimes rotated, seemed to be enhanced with greater concentration saw spirals and then ferris wheels and waterfalls or maybe falling stars (meteor showers) first on one side and then another one.  sometimes lotus flowers and roses.  then a row of many people crossing the street in a city.  and maybe a train passing by. Saw the color orange  Saw what appeared to be patterns and swirls dancing across the screen, centered where I was looking. Scary faces and heart shape scary horizontal edges which would persist then jump. occasional vertical artifacts. birds and faces Scary stuff Scintillating patterns, balls of light, lines, mostly geometric - sometimes almost like a union jack flag. But definitely not constantly that. I rotated my gaze around the screen once and that set off a sense of rotational movement to the shapes. At one point things mostly looked pink, another time, mostly blue. At several points I closed my eyes so that I was looking at the screen through my eyelids. The overall hue would change to cyan when I did this  and then somehow seem to change to white, almost like an overexposed sunlit scene. When looking away from the screen, I would continue to see colours, but finer points of light against a dark background. screen expanding and contracting, lines changing into small squares moving into center of screen Screen filling field of view. Red turning to orange, turning to yellow, turning to green. A large crowd of people moving forward through a triangular tunnel. Screen getting wider and under the screen getting white. Screen moving closer/farther, bigger/smaller, rotating circles/spirals, people crowding around looking down at me Screen rotation like a spiral, number 6 and nr 8 flying around, random patterns of light Screen rotation like a spiral, number 6 and nr 8 flying around, random patterns of light screen size shifting, blue and green screen size warping, checkered black and red patterns with green outlines, green triangles Screen turned blue off and on. It appeared to be slowly changing from blue to red. I thought it was part of the imagery and even reread the instructions after because it was so strange that the color changed.  screen was getting bigger and smaller and some circles Screen was mostly divided vertically into 3rds, with the middle 3rd popping out towards me. There was shadow on the right and lighton the left providing the relief and the edges were curved. This image was nearly constant, but continously shifting, eg middle section expanding and contracting. Saw occasional faint spider's web style lines in yellow and blue. scribbles of thin blue lines sometimes changing into pulsating red and green blotches then returning to scribbles.  sea, waves, train moving, people, a dance floor, house, sun Segmentation of the field into various shapes - irregular at first, list that 1970s glass on  bathroom  doors, then  forming triangles, squares, grids, oblongs. There were swirls moving at high speed in clockwise and non-clockwise directions receeding, coming forwards, There were galaxies of stars expanding and moving closer and  further away. All of this was in colour: red, dark blue, also yellow, purple, orange, lighter blue,  black, white. I was also hearing noises - more than the white noise. Hard to describe it: big  banging,clashing repetitive noises. I ticked that I had no feeling towards this experience but that's not true. It was just that you had no box to describe it: it made me feel a bit queezy but I also really enjoyed it  at the same time. Several different cat faces, people (both faces and whole people, people seen from an angle from behind (no face, but hair, ear, hat etc), a scene where I was speeding through a path in the woods (in motion, trees flying by), a cabin with mountains in the background, a beautiful scene where I was looking down on an old barn and it was in the style of a drawing, single trees, forests, several bats (the flying kind), a fox with very large eyes, the enormous detailed wing of a bird (like the wing was in the foreground and the head further away), a church, a scene with tall buildings, a lake with mountains on both sides and in the background. Less detailed things such as shifting horizontal bands of color, flickering bands that resemble a migraine aura (but I was not having one). Several kaleidoscopic effects that sometimes morphed or made out of skulls, birds in flight, claws coming at the screen, a tiger head on, and a sword swinging. All effects and images were in black and red contrast, not very vivid but definitively present. Several patterns with four and five fold radial symmetry. Lots of chaotic textures, like abstract expressionist paintings. Flowing or undulating surfaces. Several rivers, people dancing, complex choreography, a river valley that opened into a plains hidden in mountains, the river divided at the city and continued until the formed to large rivers that remerged into a vast flowing river. tress sunlight, buildings, grasslands clouds, everything in yellow red blacks and greys, rows and rows of spinning teeth that grew from thee distance and and in overlapping layer grew as they moved forward spinning in opposite directions just as wavy moving throat of teeth after a bit, fang like teeth. there were enormous amounts of webs, geometry and kaleidoscopic images, I often started having color images that were more thought or imagined I believe that had a origin in the visuals and became more of an idea or I was thinking about the images and got distracted by one or another. it was literal non stop imagery.  shadows shadowy figures moving, animals, trees, ghostly faces Shaking hands, a throne, a womans breasts, trees high in the sky, etc shapes and colors Shapes and images behind blinking if red and black. Also felt queasy and afraid shapes and lines shapes and patterns rotating   Shapes and patterns that started out large and became smaller and more intricate over time shapes are rolling Shapes Began To Emerge almost immediately, then colors that were not simply black and red. The variations in colors along with the shapes merged in and out of one another. Almost dancing. Suddenly A word popped in on the bottom of the screen. Then full sentences in a moving script appeared, moving from right to left across the top of the screen.  Shapes come and go and once the face of Jesus shapes like squares mostly Shapes morphing (e.g., flat grids into linear tubes while going in a circle)  shapes Primarily made up of the colour blue constantly forming and reshaping themselves all over the screen grey and black teeth radiating inward from the edges and occasional bright white lines crossing the screen horizontally.  Shapes shrinking and growing, patters flowing almost like looking at an ocean stream mapped but full of rapidly moving shapes but everything constantly changed. My center point of vision would usually turn into a rapidly evolving shape and have crazy moving patterns around it then turn into a different shape with different moving patterns around it. Shapes that look like squares and ellipses Shapes would bob around the screen, similar to ""floaters"" that you sometimes see in your eye. Sometimes the light from the screen would appear to ""bleed"" into the rest of the room, often making other small light sources (LEDs in the room, etc.) pop out much brighter. Lines would sometimes appear in the middle, flitting back and forth horizontally. Most common shape/image were rapidly rotating flower-like shapes in the center of the screen, usually extending to the edges. Shapes, faces, vehicles Shapes, facial parts, butterfly wings , shifting objects  Shapes, grid patterns, tv like static converging (many colors), faces in motion (turning left or right). Whirlpool or eddies (spiral shapes). Outlines bodies in motion (falling, spinning). Lots of green colors in shapes and patterns. Shapes, kaleidoscopic patterns, eyes, spiders, faces, time Shapes, lightning strikes shapes, like stones or tiles that were 3D, moving, pulsating, and colors changing vividly, especially around the periphery if I was focused on the center. Undulating shapes, patterns, like grids. Everything eventually (after about 6 min.) was moving quickly first in a clockwise direction, then changed to counter clockwise, then diagonally from top right to lower bottom, then from top left to lower right...then it was just changing between any of these directions. Towards the end it was spinning from the center outward very fast. shapes, patterns, colors shifting, timing changing shapes, pin points aligned into shapes Shapes, rock formations, an array of colors Shapes, the Debian logo, a chameleon, ... Shapes,colours-lots of blues and greens,people,hands,running,buildings,soaring up,flying Shapes:
Different patterns, geometric shapes and nostly ""spinning"" object like wheels, balls or light orbs etc
Colors: redz black, bright yellow and dark brown-ish green Shark swimming towards me then eye ball blinking sharks swimming in circles that later turned into birds flying in circles sharp stone spires, desert landscapes, twirly fractals Sharped edged shapes, geometrical shapes, they moved fast with the blinking. Shifting colors and shapes.  I think i will try again on a laptop, my mobile kept adjusting for light.  At some point, I felt like I entered into a stream with forests and a blue sky.  Sun was shifting over the horizon.  Towards the end I started seeing shapes of people. shifting geometric shapes and hole-like patterns Shifting patterns. Checkerboard. Floating spheres."

Sidewalk, a drawer, street, patterns, tunnel. silhouettes of mountains, seaside, peackockfeathers and people Sillouhetted shapes of angels, of roads converging, of tornado like spinning images moving accross the screen, fire work like light spurts, vague sea horizon, undefined/ghost like shapes moving from either side of the screen and converging in the middle, then drifting off screen as one unit Similar shapes as the glasses which use flickering LEDs to provoke different visual experiences with closed eyes Similar to a face in a horror movie (think like a white ghastly face almost like those internet screamers that would pop up years ago on random links). similar to when you close your eyes and apply slight pressure to your eyelids Simple geometric pattern, like a chess board skewed on the 45° Simple geometric patterns; like ripples from the corners of the screen.
Occasionally the flickering red and black screen would be perceived as a yellow or green. Simple geometric shapes like rectangles and ovals, often nested within each other. Simple geometric shapes, such as spirals and spheres. Simple patterns, mostly red/black grids or spots that were amorphous, at the center of my vision, sometimes arranged in a roughly square grid, other times with a circular pattern. At times there was the sensation that the pattern was swirling around the center or passing quickly to the right or left. The patterns would fill more than half of the area of the screen. The top and bottom of the screen tended to fade to a relatively constant black. Simple shapes (lines, slashes) but on one occasion I saw the face of a very rudimentary, almost cartoonishly-simple demon (pure black with horns and holes for the eyes and mouth hole) Simple shapes or patterns and Distortions Simple shapes... circles, stars, diamond patterns Simple stick images to portions of bodies, also text once and another vivid images like a circular lighting shape.  Once a rotating multifaceted shape. Sinking holes that turn inside out, stone statues, a wheelchair, rainbows, lightning Slightly brighter red diagonal shapes, alternating between moving from upper right to lower left, and moving from upper left to lower right. slightly slow moving and fairly blurry balls or lines moving into formations of fractals and then spinning off screen. Hallucinations became less strong over time.  Small blocks of color in center Small green dots in a grid pattern Small shapes coming together and moving to
The santer showing something that I can’t see clearly what it is and theme a aero to the left side when my bf is seat  Small square shaped bubbles small waterfall Small, highly detailed, silver fish swimming through a dark ocean, a squid emerging from the darkness to eat them. A running trail through a meadow, with a pine forest in the distance. A placid lake at night, with stars in the sky and a boat rocking on the water. A spacecraft orbiting a gas giant with a smaller craft approaching. smaller faint black squares that sometimes change into parallelograms snail shell shaped internally moving circular wave snake moving Snakes and geometric stairs Snakes writhing around the screen then facing it. Other animals as well. Some felt like they were going to come out of the screen. I also saw faces that would shift between garish and pseudo-realistic. I had feelings of space distorting, stretching, or shrinking. At points I felt as though I were in the screen, part of the movement. I frequently saw things like rings revolving, stretching out, thinning, turning into orbs that would also distort themselves. It felt like watching an old cartoon, the way that the objects would twist and distort by themselves or under the impact of others. Sometimes they would shift into basic environments like a ferris wheel, which would shift into a lake, then into a nuclear reactor, then to the atoms inside, and so on. Everything was constantly shifting. snow flake Snow or heavy rainfall, the same hillish snowy area repeatedly. Two mountains side by side. An angry face to my right would show up consistently and to the left would be another face with a random expression. At one point a turkey facing me appeared and I think I saw a spaceship from Galaga, it definitely had the same patterns as the ship. The turkey was the scariest part just because animals facing me and staring is something I consider freaky. Lots of vertical bars flashing. Occasionally it would seem like my monitor was duplicating or extending and then a pair of hands would appear to be grasping my monitor from behind. The most consistent part of the whole thing was an effect similar to entering hyperspace or going to lightspeed in media such as Star Wars. I also constantly heard horse hooves stomping. Snow, landscapes, a galaxy, a spinning, color changes, falling thru a pattern of boxes, the beach, a landscape with white ground and dark sky, a tunnel , someone looking from a far snowflakes, mandalas, fractures and bubbles So like lots of bright colors so a lot of white so lots of wine images shapes feel like I was in a tunnel very beautiful Happy feeling the sound was it would get louder and faint faint and louder echoing very enjoyable and relaxing So much. I saw cartoon sketches and was able to somewhat control them until I tried to control them too much, then they faded to some thing else.
I saw images from history, I saw atom bombs exploding and mushroom clouds forming, I saw many thousands of faces of people some I know personally others I know of, yet others I cannot recall seeing.
I saw buildings and forests and ships and cars and streetscapes and and and. some dots. like infrequent stars in the sky Some geometric shapes and grid patterns Some geometric stuffs  some geometrical shapes like lines, cubes etc. and they are keep changing. when I blink my eyes it is starting to re form and start to see after a few second new shapes and images. It is starting from the my focus to other sites of the screen. some grid, big black round points on red background, sometimes I saw one light point crossing the image from bottom right to top left Some images were clear and vivid where I could see details of it, others looked like shadows but I could make out what the image was some keys and doors, some dots making drone Some kind of flowers,a deer,some geometric shape and i saw a skull some kind of pyramids with rainbow color lines  Some moments where the colour(s) were other than red or black, perhaps shade of green or blue, or pale indistinct colour (but not pure white). Simple grid patterns of small dark balls. A central pale fuzzy ball. Perhaps (and I'm very unsure about this) a random pattern of short straight lines, similar to crazy paving lines Some patterns from the edges. A line that looked like it was going to open into a new image but never did.  Some patterns like soap bubbles. At another point a radial dial like spokes of a spinning wheel. At another, rainbow waves appearing from the edges of my faintly reflected face. Some recurring pulsing flashes in a sea of confusion. Not images as such, more like visual sensations. More than half-way in the screen seemed to become purple and not changing, but then returned to pulsing flashes of yellow in a sea of confusion of red, with irregular and intermittent yellow patterns Some simple lines, not straight but sort of like cracks Some spiral-galaxy like vortices moving around and rotating into each other; stripes moving rapidly to the left, rotating spiderweb shapes. At one point, screen distortion where the size suddenly looks a little bigger and smaller, occasionally discretely (could also be my eyes no longer focusing). some things looked like gears locked and rotating together, others were just balls of light with simple geometric shapes rotating around them, at one point it felt like i was zooming past a line of very indistinct figures but it then morphed into gears again some variation in the red/black switch that occasionally looked shadowy some words, letters, grids, heads of greys (alien) Someone carrying a person that got murdered and putting him in an ambulance and the police being in the crime scene  Something firing a sweeping laser from the left to right of my screen focusing directly at me halfway, fast moving objects hurdling around, faces appearing in my periphery, a long dragon speeding across the surface of water, creatures fighting, a sea of fractals Something like a spining blackhole or a circle, also random ligths  Something like flying balloon Something resembling a flower blooming, more like the idea of it, not so much seeing it. Also saw some kind of grid on the sides of the screen as if it was a tunnel leading to the screen and the grid were the walls.Don't really feel like i hallucinated anything, kinda like staring at the sun and then closing your eyes sort of thing. Something that appeared like a laser in bright red shining at various parts of the screen, something like a warp tunnel (circular, appearing to move inward), occasionally something that looked like bits of a dark forested area from above, some diamond-shaped grid patterning Sometimes a ball of light, then it merged to a tunnel that flyed trought the screen. Sometimes I would catch a pseudo-beigeish ball of light moving in a small fast circle in the middle of my phone. Mostly, after a few minutes, it shifted from being a clear full-screen red black flicker to having a bit of a gradient at the edge. No hard edges shapes or objects manifested. Sometimes it's like a Big Bang with many waves and electricity. 
Other images just like the old Windows Media Player 11 visualizations.
I saw mostly red and dark blue. The other colors can be black, orange, yellow. Rarely saw white or bright yellow. sometimes the lights would appear to spin in the center of my vision, other times they seemed to move in and out. Sometimes the screen looked three-dimensional. I mostly saw things that resembled snakes slithering around in circles or polygons with rounded corners, and then the shape they were making would distort into a different shape. I would also frequently see a ball of light wherever I was directly looking. I have been seeing this sort of imagery since I was a small child, mostly after I would wake up in the morning and then look at the walls in my room. I would see all kinds of things of this quality, and I never liked it.  sometimes the screen seems 3 dimensional, like the colours were bulging forward, the ren varied in shades from almost orange, to darker red Sometimes there were sections which were swirling, like a galaxy. Other times I sensed there was movement, or streaks of movement, which sometimes went left to right, R to L, up to down, D to U, corner to corner, etc. Then sometimes it felt like I was speeding into or out of the middle of a chasm. There were also waves on occasion. And then occasional flashes of blue, which I felt was probably a physical reaction from my vision. Sometimes threads or webs, sometimes patterns of flicker vertical, horizontal and circular. A few times rounded vertical terrain like hoodoos Sometimes when I blinked, I saw green. Other than that, the screen seemed a bit fuzzy, and occasionally it briefly looked geometrical, but that was all. The rest of the time it just flashed black and red.  Sometimes... Circular patten of gradient blobs that flashed and palate shifted with the strobing. The number of blobs around the pattern would start as a four quadrant type division then each section would further subdivide over the course of a few seconds. Until it was 12 to 16 blobs around the circle.
Other times more of a gradient shifting grid.
Changing the brightness and distance to the screen would shift which kind of pattern I would get.
Occasionally some blue, jagged, bolts would spiderweb the view in parts, but they didn't have any discernable pattern or form and quickly shifted around and faded. Sort of like a spider web, in that the periphery was larger and details became smaller towards the center, and it was irregular lines, like tree roots  South American Continent about once, and the rest of the time all I could see was grid lines Space imagery, geometric shapes, oceans, forests. Mostly night sky. spaceship cockpits from videogames I played long in the past Sparkles, geometric shapes, raindrops on a windshield, strobing sun rays, indentations in gray stone of circles that reminded me of Mickey Moise. Speed of flicker and colour intensity changed spider web of connected blobs like of brain neurons and synapses Spider web of tiny black, purple, and white triangles Spider web type images, sometimes like glass blowing in the wind Spider webs and different colors but mostly black blobs spider webs type shapes around the entire screen ---  eye/retina shape - mostly in the middle areas Spider webs, honeycomb, rolling waves, spinning screen, spiralling shapes like a carpet rolling up, sparklers spider webs, images that reminded me of pictures you see of the neural network in the brain,..geometric orbs,a tunneling effect Spider-Man Spiders spiders, round-bodied multi-legged objects that move symmetrically both to and from the center, crabs, black little cute boys and girls, kids with hijab, curvy and shapely women, rabbits move symmetrically, streets with trees, space wormhole with colours Spiderwebs were followed by two spheres orbiting each other. Whenever I blinked, this had a tendency to ""reset"" and distinguishing visuals. However, at this point it would always restart back to the orbiting spheres. Extended durations had the two spheres becoming a ""wheel"" of spheres orbiting a center point on the screen, eventually bouncing around the screen in random motions. Towards the end, the very general shape of a human torso manifested, twisting from side to side as if in a simple dance. The torso seemed to take on more female proportions, and even swinging hair to match the movement (again, with no real detail or vividness).  spiderwebs, lines and grids, blues and reds Spikey fractals that circled the centre in rings Spinning circles and waves Spinning circles which shifted into spirals, if I blinked they might reverse from clockwise to anticlockwise. The perspective of the circles kept moving slowly. Sometimes I saw a bar of black moving up and down the screen against a red background. Spinning circles, faces. spinning lights, the screen would occasionally push out at me in the area i was looking, a large spinning +, lights like on a ferris wheel after dark spinning quickly, almost dizzying. spinning objects like saw blades. felt like watching some kind of space scene where the objects were weightless and floating/rotating. Interesting geometric patterns at the start of it too. Spinning saw like discs, slithering morphing geometric patterns, star like pattern that extended out to me, twisting lines that wrapped each other and ran parallel to each other, a few flashing ball objects Spinning shapes and other geometric designs. I also saw purple/blue. Spinning star tunnels, static galaxies, roads, lake and mountains, red tessellated starfish Spinning wheels of multicolored light, something like a waterfall of colored light, both looking down on it and shifting perspective to have it fall down on me, fields of stars flying past, moving human-like figures around the edges of the screen, some white, some in shadowy colors, moving black balls on a red field, and other things I can't describe Spiraling circles, then red, yellow and blue fish swimming across the screen as though I were looking at them from above, then red and yellow comets shooting from the bottom right to top left of screen"

Swords rapidly across the screen, rising upward in the middle and back down, like a wave signature. something on a bicycle doing the same repetition. Flames. Oranges and blues and reds colors.  spirals that became staircases, changing colors. A church balcony with purple sky. Waterfalls, crashed at the bottom of the screen and poured out. Images shrank and grew beyond. Constantly snapped back to a checker pattern after images. Spirals! Galaxies! Blackholes merging together and Spacetime warping! Like I was a being traveling through the universe, and this was my only sensory feeling, quite boring to be a being only experiencing that! Glad I settled to become a human! Aihihi

also the room I was in, was almost like spiraling, moving, and the objects with me are like, influenced by mind, quite entertaining! spirals, concentric rings, simple fractals centered on the point of perception, waves and patterns of asymmetrically moving bars Spirals, fractals, spinning discs with rays pointed out, a ""snake"" consisting of spheres in 3D placed snaking across the screen Spirals, some green lines in the motion spirals, twisting lines, an under the ocean perspective Splintered light, shape (symmetrical, bilateral, heart shaped), figures (sillouetes, as if through window, many on a train, single or couple offering or sharing, holding baby, fetus shape), bright flashes, white images, transitory, flowing like a story, black/blank abysses alternating with fast/active colorful video on fast forward
White noise wàs binaural 144Hz/35.3 bps. Begins rhythmic/musical like percussion soundtrack, becoming surges that felt emotional, accompanying imagery with swells (together with rapid/story imagery) and floating/suspension (with black voids) spots and webs of light square patterns brief torso and head some dark colors (blue) Square patterns distorting from the center of the screen towards the borders of the screen. Sometimes faint shades of green and yellow. Square,  circle, something similar to a spade,  water drops, wriggling lines.  Square-like fractals that had depth to them. squares and circles Squares and circles moving around like fractals, some in the shape of an infinity sign. For a second, I had seen the color yellow, so I wondered if I could see other colors and eventually I saw the color blue. I also saw what looked like a leafless tree. After the first 5 minutes, I came out of focus and it was very hard to keep seeing the images. squares and snowflake-like stars (simple horizontal and diagonal lines forming a star) squares and stars, sometimes I saw the white color squares moving around Squares with lines radiating from each corner, similar but with other central shapes  Squares within squars, cross, hand, face, colors Squares, circles, other shapes Squares, grid moving like blackened red tornado from left to right  Squares, grids Squares, the screen wobbling, coming out of the screen etc. Stacked round rocks...luje around a well stained glass windows with a floral pattern (Iris) Standard stuff like the screen appearing to move, then something like a flaming cave and then it went kinda matrix like with non english words and sentences appearing quasi randomly around the screen. By non english I mean it appeared like arabic or oriental standing on boats Standing on the edge of a grove of deciduous trees, bright sun very vivid. Seemed like summertime, easy to make out individual trees and leaves  Star Star wars hyperspace, then pokemon (Butterfree, then Ho-Oh), then a rainbow flag, then a rainbow Ho-Oh, then ascending up through the clouds into heaven, then a ruby cross starbursts of blue, swirling yellow light, white scratches, patterns that looked like tree foliage  starry dark sky with the stars buzzing about forming a spiderweb, 
spiralling balls of fire sometimes one, sometimes two
tiny sprays of colour blue and green all over the screen  stars, comet going across the screen, shadow of a woman walking across the screen, upside down V shapes, upside down U shapes, screen warping stars, eyes, dancing geometrical shapes or even human figures like Ancient Greek pots stars, people around a fire, circles, whirlpools, going through a tunnel fast like driving. a face once, a hand. shapes were brighter than background like orange or yellow.  Stars, something like shooting out from a tunnel and swerving, like kaleidoscope  stars, the sun, geometric patterns, colours blue, green, yellow,  purple Started as a web of lines forming geometrical shapes of shadow in the red light the became something looking from within the screen watching me as I watched it. Mirroring my gaze where ever I directed it Started as an up-down 'red cross' cross shape of red, blue and black flashes. Alternated between flat rotating circular patterns and '3D' rotating shapes like a vision of galaxies, sometimes, briefly, like a tunnel off to the right with shapes flowing into it. Watched for ~3 minutes Started as line of energy, morphed into geometric shapes dancing with music on tv. Saw oranges yellows. Saw the sun and comet converging i guess. Stars. The borders fade in and out.  Started off as random flashes of patterns--grids of bright spots, broken diagonal lines, complicated fractal-like geometric colors--then resolved into a sequence of geometric shapes moving in complex patterns (reminded me a bit of Disney's Fantasia combined with psychedelic art) that moved into a scene that reminded me of driving down a long elevated highway (e.g., the Frankland Bridge over Tampa Bay or I-10 along the southwestern edge of Lake Pontchartrain between Baton Rouge and New Orleans) with large metalwork on both sides that arched above and interlaced, making interesting patterns as I drove along. Last thing I saw was a vaguely ziggurat-like building topped with large metallic sails (or maybe rigid metal fins that looked like sails) with a striped pattern. Started off immediately with almost a flashing blurry grid.  This shifted into what seemed like falling through a bright elevator shaft. It switched between going forward and backward through the shaft if I thought about it being forward or backward. This started to get more vivid. It seemed like it was combining with the grid pattern I saw earlier. It looked like that one scene from the movie Interstellar where the guy is falling through that 4D space. It wasn't very detailed but it felt like that scene. I closed my eyes a few times for a couple seconds each and saw a wide circle of grey static. When I would reopen my eyes the visuals were less detailed but would gradually grow back. Sometimes Instead of the grid patterns I would see bright blue glowing beams and streaks swipe across the screen. Near the end, the falling through the pattern started to shift into flowing spirals. These spirals eventually turned into rollercoasters spiraling down a track toward the center of my vision. These images were pretty detailed but went away after a few seconds. They came back a couple more times. Started out as flickering geometric shapes. Bright flashes of yellow, green aura like halos around shapes. Then shapes became more complex and blended into one another, becoming animal like faces, then strange buildings like a futuristic city. Colors popped out limagenta, bright green,, swirling into reds, yellows, some neon like. Flashes of bright blue. Started out as geometric shapes and fractals which morphed into glowing red and orange butterflies flying from the edges of the screen. Also saw arcs of orange electricity crackling around the screen edges and boiling liquid across the whole screen. Started out with circles then triangles then crosses, then a line that rotated, morphing from shape to shape. 
I was seeing a cloudy/noisy pattern as like a 'background' and those shapes were somewhat like a moire effect over that.
The sides of the screen seemed pulsing/expanding at times as I felt my vision change its focus repeatedly. Started out with palm trees in several spots on the screen then it's changed and looked like riding a car through a forest canopy. After that it looked like being under water and looking up at the ripples/water line above me. following this it began to look like riding through a tunnel at very fast speeds.  Started seeing stripes like things but diagonally, and they seemed to be where ever I was looking at on the screen Started to see a ball take shape this slowly moved from the centre to the top as it moved it seemed to be growing by gathering particles from around itself much like a gravitational draw.  The ball flickers with green blue and even purple after a few minutes.  The scenario repeated a few times. I felt i could control an aspect of the ball.  Like whether it formed and when it formed how much it grew and when it expired. After 5mins or so i began to feel ill  and stopped the experiment. Started with a hand, finger tips turning into balls of light, swirled into a circle, door, and eye ball behind the door started with a plus sign then forest .Then a man inside the castle with big windows and long curtains Started with a white noise, like a disconnected tv, then a spinning votex all around the screen with an enmpty space in the middle, then the space moved (like seeing tornado from a top down view. Later the spot moved, and around it fractals appeared, after that refresh scan lines going across the screen in a rythmic manner, then it was back to fractals. There were no real images, just total chaos of wild geometric shapes. All though now I feel like I have a hangover, I loved it :D  started with an X image in the screen. It was kind of like it was being drawn on the screen with 2 quick downward slashes. Then that kind of changed into a hallway. Then I noticed the blue and green flashes. Then there was kind of a swirling pattern and then the screen was kind of divided into a grid. Then there was an impression of the screen ""boiling"". The ""bubbles"" were interesting but fleeting. It seemed as though if I moved my eyes the effect on the screen would change from the spiraling, slashes, grid, boiling, and hallway. Lots of interesting visuals. I didn't seem to see things coming ""out of the screen"" but I felt like I was seeing ""into"" the screen. Started with circles, like ripples from a stone dropping directly into a calm body of water. then moved to triangles, squares, overlapping triangles creating diamond shapes. color changes seemed more like going through the rainbow and back very quickly, didn't seem to get to black but rather a very dark blue. eventually shapes coalesced into more complex items, so small circles on the edge of a big spinning circle (almost like looking down at carousel, or spinning disc, 3 of these were on screen at one point, though could only see 1/2-3/4 of each as hung off top l corner, bottom center, and right hand side. after that it was like being in top of a tunnel with a car racing towards me on bottom, and then 'video' followed car as it went underneath. then it became a circular tunnel winding like a waterslide, with either circular, square, or octagonal lights making a very close pattern all the way down. eventually got to bottom of tunnel and then image was floating outside large rectangular box, could see tunnel in it. and then end of image where 'tunnel' exited it started moving away and side of box went across screen diagonally. then more tunnels but viewing from outside as if watching something push through space and create tunnel (similar to slo-mo bullet through water maybe?) colors changed around a lot of the shapes and images differently to other parts of the screen. started with circles, then violet lines, then movements are across the screen in different directions, and the screen getting darker while closing in and reopening. Many different patterns of balls and spheres moving in and out with primary red and black colors but occasionally purple.  Started with geometric shapes forming 2 3-D ""cones"" going into the screen. I saw blue color flashing along with red and black. Then started seeing complex shapes. First a fairly vivid tiger that walked towards me and turned to walk sideways when it reached the screen. The only reason i felt it did not look more real was because everything was tinted in red as if an actual red flashing light was the actual light source of the scene. Then it all morphed into what looked like being inside a structure with a couple of open arches that reached from the floor to 8-10 ft high. Just beyond the arches was parked a white car. This was also quite vivid and looked like I was actually seeing the scene in front of me except for the red tint on everything. Besides the white noise, I did not hear anything else. Started with geometric shapes that moved around and morphed into each other. Then a vortex or iris shape near the center and the shapes started to fall into the iris pattern and it seemed like looking through multi-colored boiling water. The ten minutes of white noise seemed to pass very rapidly as it felt like I was looking at the flicker for maybe 3 or 4 minutes at most, yet it was a full 10 minutes. Started with green and red shapes, mostly half-moons swirling in symetrical circles. Then shifted to more of a blue colour tone, where I could make out flashes of images on the screen - mostly shapes of landmarks/rooms, ocassional faces. Although definitely felt like the imagery was situated in my mind's eye (like a day-dream with open eyes) rather than appearing on the screen. I wasn't seeing the imagery with my eye but in my mind, but it seemed to be triggered by/correlate with the flashes.  Started with images of waves rolling on to a beach which was transfigured in to triangles and squares interlapping and rolling in to each-other, shifting in to planets which orbited a sun which shot out waves at them, I became engrossed in the imagery and I enjoyed it, but it seemed to almost distort my actual reality, which upon realizing, I forced myself to stop. Strong feelings. I have done a LOT of psychedelic drugs in my life - this was actually one of the strongest hallucinatory experiences I've ever had. Will repeat.

Willing to discuss further; you can email me at panarkacorporation@gmail.com for any additional studies. Willing to co-author a paper about this phenomena. Started with light squares and dark lines, then after awhile I started seeing spinning dots in a circular motion. Then around the mid of 10 minutes I started seeing fractal shapes between, behind, the squares appearing a few times. In the end I was surprised how quickly the time passed as I wasn't sure why the white noise stopped, and I kept going for a little bit more. Started with lines, but looked like unclear lines of text, also mostly centered.
Geometric shapes made of circles or spheres, like snowflake patterns but circles instead of lines. Mirrored left/right. Mostly center, but appeared in any section of the screen I focused on.
Other colors too: dark blue and green all over, yellow-orange around the edges that faded in. Started with shapes like flowers and stars moving into a rainbow then fields and forests and towns from over head. Floating with the clouds looking down. Urgency.  Started with written text in overlappping layers (different size font) at the top and bottom of screen which started stationary then started moving. The words were clear but I didn't think to read them. They stayed for about 1-2mins then faded. Then nothing for a short while. Then geometric shapes started appearing, never in focus, and they faded in and out (circles, then squares, then rhombuses, then triangles, then random 3D geometric shapes morphing into each other). This continued to the end. About 4/5mins in I started getting black tendrils appear in the periphery. They became more vivid over time and got closer to the centre of the screen. Around 6ish minutes there was a short break with no shapes or tendrils. Then a yellowish ball started glowing, fading in and out, left of the centre of my gaze but only just on the edge of the centre. Then there was a grey figure standing in front of it, becoming more clear like turning up a dimmer switch. I then saw the edge of a forest (in the forest looking out) which was almost diagonal across the centre of the screen (around 30deg angle, left(low) to right) and an animal (a dog or deer maybe) ran through the trees followed by the figure walking left to right through the trees. The animal and the figure both paused in the centre for a few moments. The tendrils then reached after them. This faded and the blue lines, a yellowish light and the geometric shapes became clearer. Then the white noise stopped and it distracted me. Starting after only a few seconds, the screen began to distort, and the edges of the screen ""disappeared"".  The red flicker seemed to leak out of the screen and was joined by green spider webs.  Geometric shapes began to appear in the flicker, moving around on the screen.  At times the images would appear to spin in increasing speed.  After several minutes I adjusted so that I was closer to the screen (therefore taking up more of my field of view).  Then I could see red and green fireworks within the flicker.  After 10 minutes I closed my eyes and the geometric shapes persisted for several seconds, then were replaced by a black and grey grid pattern for about a minute before fading entirely. Starting by seeing an eye in the middle, then a butterfly, followed by a crystal structure, then had a feeling like traveling through a tunnel, as well as seeing a flotila of space ships pass by. Starting immediately: 1-3 lines intersecting at center of my view, rotating at waring speeds, bending, combing and splitting. These remained for the whole 10 min.
3 min.: more complex shapes started moving in a more chaotic manner.
6 min.: formed unstable snaking patterns fazing in and out.
8 min.: colors other than red started replacing black in the flashing, mainly bluish gray in the center of view, other colors to the sides.
9 min.: original lines formed organized and stable corners of tunnels and rooms covered in vague and shifting fractal patterns. Starting with waves, shapes usually on the edges. Movement, occurred and it seemed as if the screen was travelling on a plane flying and banking. Eventually in the centre of the screen a ball started to grow that eventually grew dots around it. It looked like a galaxy with the ball  part being the centre. Ie where a black hole would sit in a real galaxy. The galaxy was rotating in different directions as if being explored from different angles. The stars on the outter edges were blue! Definitely did not expect to see that. It was quite marvelous scientifically speaking.  Starting, I didn’t see anything then suddenly I felt like I was in the back seat of a car riding through a tunnel that had lights in it, I was in the tunnel for a bit (wasn’t scary or uncomfortable at all, quite nice,) then I started to see what looked like a bright orb, I’m going to call it the sun because that’s the closest thing it resembled to me, it floated around the screen & suddenly changed to missiles firing off into the corners of the screen, (I started to feel a bit uncomfortable because I felt like I couldn’t control what I was seeing even thought it was my mind playing it out) Next, what looked like heat waves started showing up all over the screen with the missiles and then the missiles began to fade out and a beautiful pond started fading in. This was my favorite part of the whole experience!!
It was so calm peaceful & pretty vivid, no auditory hallucinations (at any point in time) but white noise was playing. After the pond left me, I started to notice that the screen was looking orange & blue, no longer red & black. Then I saw a big sphere that was slowly spinning around, As I kept looking, it looked more & more like the Earth tilted on its axis. The colors started changing again so I decided to leave the experience.. I’d most definitely do this again!! Stickman, geometric shapes, web  Stone walls and I'm not sure what else I want to try longer Stop sign strands/bars in random direction of more intense colour on green/blue patches. Didn't know that it flickers to black from red, didn't have impression of black at all.  Strange  Strange  Straw, pulsing target and distant people Streets at night with cars passing by and being blinded by headlines. The time vortex from Doctor Who. Intricate spinning patters (kind of like the scene in Doctor Strange when the ancient one is showing him ""the universe"") where the patterns morphed into new patterns, growing organically. Strings of lights swirling into the distance, silhouettes of landscapes/buildings, swirling disks, ""x"" shape moving around the screen. Stripes, Chessboard, Balls Stripes, diagonal as well as horizontal and vertical, lighter colored orbs moving, geometric shapes, triangles, squares, random curved lines, complex geometric shapes like mechanical spider legs or something like a spaceship. strobing patterns, streaking or swirling lines, a vague figure in the lower right of the screen. things like explosions. structure like spoked wheels or spider webs stuff Stuff Stylized, video-game style Chinese dragons with puffs of smoke and wind; knights on horseback in a joust; flowers opening and morphing into small firecrackers bursts Sun sun sun and the moon, spiral lightnings and waves of blue water. purple and blue things too. Sometimes orange energy (?) came there too. sun, and a skyline with grass, later on intersecting lines appeared to form a cross sunsets, seas, volcanos, mountains, geometrical shapes Swirl patterns, shapes, animals, greens, brown, red, black and dark blue Swirling darkness that seemed to pull me in. Swirling galaxies, flying inside of slowly rotating 3D objects, juxtaposed counter rotating 3D objects, red and blue waves of particles like a wave you’d surf on. Very crisp. Vivid but only red and blue colors. A lot of rotating churning fractal like imagery. Flying through a space station. Flowing kaleidoscopes but again only red and blue. No sounds.

Swirling light patterns spinning from the center or bouncing in from the sides, sometimes like fireworks sparking and sometimes more smooth and liquid.  Main color was red with black, dark blue, and occasionally yellow.  Main shape noticed was an ""x"" "

Also sort of a hallway effect, made of the pastel points of light. Swirling shapes and colors, mostly swirling shapes for the most part and at one point a fat women swirling vortex leading to a decent down a fractal spiral. then moving past stars at lightspeed, then a man walking then binary stars then a sun in the distance Swirls and stars like the sky, teal blue in a dark blue/purple background  Sword, Meat eater plant, Pikachu, Balbasar Swords, soldiers ,colors,etc Swrils , circles , the whole screen warping , things enlarging  symmetric faces, shapes, lines Symmetric shapes and lines.  usually 4 quarters.  I could move the middle by moving my eyes.  I could also create lines through the middle by moving my eyes along those axes. Symmetrical patterns of geometrical movement.  Sometimes faint lines like hairs. If I half-closed or closed my eyes, the patterns became more detailed and complex. Closed eyes after Ganzflicker off, beautiful mandala shape in tracery of illuminated Tron-line lines that was fairly static but shifted slightly -- centre of shape clearer. Tapas/batik cloth like geometric patterns morphed into diamond & concentric circles in orange and red with change to blue framing and yellow starburst into the middle. Settled into a black/blue and red orange harlequin pattern, occasionally with red bands at the top and bottom tapestries, honeycomb patterns, molecular models, shapes that reached out Faint vertical, horizontal, and diagonal lines, mostly where I was looking. Not on the whole l screen. lines was litle pink little yellow Textual impressions started very early and remained throughout, though waned steadily over time. Variously felt text was scrolling horizontally or vertically (from either direction) or just flashing each page for a microsecond. Visual overstimulation Similar to staring into a bright light; occasionally thought I saw red-green-black flicker. (The green reminded me of staring at a colored shape, then quickly switching to a blank surface and seeing the after image as a negative - green for red, etc.) Textured surface similar to broken glass or crumpled paper Textured wall, images of galaxies  The back drop of a city that turned into mountains as if I was in a moving vehicle.  The ball looked like an egg, the border was black and the center was red. It looks like this 🌀. It traveled on top of my screen slowly. The beginning was a series of diamond shapes coming towards me like a tunnel. There started to be a deep blue flashing instead of black. Greenish blue faces began emerging similar to the colors of blobs when falling asleep (idk if this is just me or not?) Heavy, quick, spiraling towards the end. Began seeing stout, humanoid silhouette shapes spiraling at the end of 10 min. The best thing that could describe my experience is a caleidoscope, just that I could see two sets shapes, the background was red and one of those shapes was formed by shadows of black and the other one was fainter but was far more complex in terms of geometric shapes (sometimes had 2 axis of refraction, other 3) and was blue in color. I found out that I could let my mind's eye wander and I could see some faint ""daydream"" wich I could somewhat control. The black changed to blue and the red became more constant The black quickly turned to blue. I saw a basketweave pattern, like streaks across the screen. The black turned to cyan, and it looked like I could see both colors of the time. The black flashes looked more like a rolling shutter and every once in a while I saw simple shapes like lines. The blacks on the red were increasing like the lines you see when turning up your computer volume. And black ""things"" on red that I can't describe  The blinking red eventually turned green/pine blue. Faint images emerged in that blueness like a b&w photo, then disappeared again. I saw the rooftop of a house with the sky overhead and treetops in the periphery. Other times, I saw lines which seemed organized like a complex cubist painting in red, blue, green, of cartoonish human figures. the blob of constant movement would take on various forms over and over again. from circle to square to star-shaped, into black or red or green or dark blue or purple or yellow. also momentary seconds where a face or shapes would form in the mass The bottom part of the screen was blue and I saw faint rainbow streaks in some parts of the screen mostly in the center of the screen. The clearest images I saw were simple shapes but they were coming at me or going away from me like if you put two mirrors together and you see infinite copies. That happened to me several times with shapes such as circles, squares, an uneven triangle, and hexagons. I remember that happening when things seemed to waver between being green and blue and red, like in a dream when things can be multiple things at once( like you know you're in your house but it's also your friend's back yard). There were other times I briefly saw thick vertical bars in the top of my vision.  Mostly when I saw something I saw a hazy starburst pattern in my central vision, in my periphery I saw flames or electrical looking movement around the edges of the starburst always radiating outward.  The rest of the time my eyes felt like they wanted to water or they were trying to focus over and over again. the compter lost its border and would constantly shrink grow and move around  The corners in a darker shade with lines going diagonally into the center and creating a tunnel like thing in the enter…  The dark parts faded away and the red turned orange, but no images in the actual screen. The different shapes were rapidly changing too quickly for me to focus on, at one point it was stars, at another flowers, all random colors although the red and black was insistent. The only consistent image was Jake the dog, probably because I have been watching Adventure Time for the first time recently, and he was the correct color a lot of the times. The distortions had somewhat of a rainbow hue to them. It would start as a horizontal line throughout the screen, then warp on each side. The left side would warp down towards a third of the way up on the left side, and the right side would warp up to a third of the way down on the right side. It would fluctuate with no clear sense of direction. I'd see a ball manifest at about a third below the midpoint of the screen, with rays of light radiating from it.  The distortions were extremely rapid. Mostly I saw many balls sort of dancing around each other in geometric patterns. The locus was generally where my eyes were focused. I saw a sort of green color near the edges of the screen. The dominant color was a bluish black, and the red became an orange color, like a barely remaining sunset. I mostly saw spiral shapes... like pinwheels that would appear to be spinning quickly but would slow down and tilt and eventually disappear until my brain ""caught"" the next one. It was sort of like waiting to see a shooting star, catching it, then watching it disappear. After about 15 minutes I started to see a landscape. Trees on an embankment near a body of water at sunset, sort of blurry and barely visible. the dust on the screen. perhaps a black x or something.  the edges were pale pink, the center changed between concentric circles and concentric plus signs The experience was as if I was looking out a window onto a blizzard at night, I guess. The flickering took the form of snowy wind, swirling in a chaotic manner. To clarify, I didn’t see anything like a snowy, night scene. I didn’t see a window, a window frame, an outdoor setting, snow, or wind. It’s just that the flickering was reminiscent of blizzard-y wind filling the whole volume of a natural space. I did see, however, pinpoints of yellowy green light that swirled about the flickering red/black field of my phone screen in a manner akin to blowing of fine snow in a blizzard. So, to clarify further, the yellowy green pinpoints swirled, as did the red/black flickering itself. At a couple of moments in the experience, the pinpoints of yellowy green light seemed to lift out of the screen a bit, but just a bit. I should also add that in the first few minutes the flickering not only swirled but also rolled, sometimes up to down and other times down to up, as a reel of film moving quickly through a projector and across a screen. This “cinematic” rolling also seemed to move sideways at times, but it was hard to distinguish this sideways rolling motion from the more evident up/down and down/up rolling. the explosion of a planet The feeling of motion was very constant, changing direction around the screen. Various grids would form and vanish, or lines of light appearing to emanate from a single location, changing in patter and speed.  The first ~10 min was w/white noise, which seemed to affect my perception of environment more than it did the visualization. The first ~5 min I didn’t really settle in too well (more a consequence of viewing environment), and I bounced between focused and unfocused vision. That period was dominated by perception of rapidly shifting light and color that wasn’t as much static patterns as it was a synchronous “scattering” of alternating light and color in variable motion across the screen according to which direction, and mode and interval of movement I chose to follow w/my eyes. Eventually, I began to see that motion as tick marks across the top of the screen and imagined I was looking to the edge of a roulette wheel from the shadows of the center, the white noise mimicking the sound of the wheel ticking, and the motion of the ticks began curving around me. When I began to relax my eyes, there was a perception of environment that I will describe as abstract, palpable—and somewhat unsettling, even when the imagery morphed. While the imagery was never clear, each “scene” seemed to have an overarching theme of an inferno that, though the thought of fire normally elicits visions of bright flames, it was always cloaked in darkness. Either I was at a midnight rave and saw strobed light that seemed to pulsate to the music’s beat and shadows of hands in the air briefly blocking the light, or I was stepping from cold, black space into the vaporous billows of the sun’s surface, or staring into the pit of a volcano at the roiling lava lake from the edge of the crater and dark night, trying to see the trees through dense smoke from a wildfire that turned day nearly to night, or trying to make out figures through a smoky haze smelling of gunpowder from freshly fired muskets and lit canons. I was always struggling to get a better view in dimly lit, partially obscured scenes; but then the experience turned more sentient than visual for me, and I felt I was being watched—even stalked, and almost hunted. I somewhat locked onto that feeling, and the more complex scenery became being lost in the shadows of a city at night, and though nobody else seemed to be out, between the flashing hues of black and red and sometimes blue, my eyes became stuck on a shadow protruding from the corner of the screen. If I stayed focused on that, it didn’t seem to change in my vision, but I felt as though somebody—or something—was lurking. If I let my eyes relax, the shadow became a dark figure that moved across screen and was suddenly much closer, causing me to feel the unease of being followed—possibly a Freudian metaphor for the internet and privacy, or lack thereof. It was during the periods of watching and being watched that the test seemed more sentient than visual for me. While having the white noise playing contributed to the overall “atmosphere” by integrating as musical beats, jetting gases, volcanic explosions, crackling fire, or firing weapons, it lent to a more ominous feeling when “being followed in the nighttime cityscape,;” but it didn’t seem to affect the visual imagery. Once the noise stopped, the “shadow who was following me” seemed to move across the screen more frequently in the silence; but sentience gradually gave way to visualization. I don’t know if there was a correlation between the shadow’s frequency and white noise/silence, if my perception changed as I began to focus my vision in the last few minutes, or if there was, indeed, a shadow moving across screen w/greater frequency then…or? Once maximum focus was achieved, I was back in the hub of the roulette wheel fixed, as it spun, moving fractals with my mind—east to west, up to down, radiating, pulsating—until I saw bullseyes radiating to pinpricks with each pulse away from me, at which point I compared the experience to lying in a dark room w/my eyes closed while listening to binaural beats at a specific frequency, at which point I realized boredom. That experience, in comparison to this test, was like comparing a dmt trip (I’ve never consumed dmt, just the alleged natural release) to being stoned. I experienced a lasting clarity of mind and vivid imagery, and perceiving a feeling of transcendence and inner peace with that experience. For the most part, I’m coming away from this test feeling unsure to mostly indifferent; hence, boredom setting in. Good luck—hope this helps! The first 30 seconds or so, I wondered if anything would happen. Then suddenly I felt myself enter a different state of consciousness, and I felt relaxed and it felt very nice, but I still didn't see anything. I was beginning to think I might end up not seeing anything, when suddenly I saw Jesus in the center of the screen, then he was moving closer. That was so amazing. Then I saw a campfire in the center of the screen with people all around, everything moving. Then it disappeared and I saw jazz hands on the upper right. Then I saw a triangle with lava spewing from the top. Then I saw what looked like random shadows in my peripheral vision on the bottom of the screen. After that, I saw saw little flickers  of shadows I couldn't make out, everywhere moving in random places. Then I saw veins vividly, vertically and everywhere. They were moving, disappearing and appearing. Then I saw a tree on the left side with a forest behind it. The first few minutes I would see like a heart shape appear - it would grow and then disappear.  Various squares and things.  
It took about 4-5 minutes before a repeating geometric shape started to appear and pretty much remained.  Mostly it was a spinning shape. Like a pie it would start out with a few pieces (4) which radiated outward, then the pieces would multiply again and again until it became one and then kind of start over.  Mostly the spinning was counter clockwise, but did switch directions.  Later in the experiment I saw two of the them side by side and then merged into one.  I did occasionally see yellow and blues, but not sure if it was a monitor issue.  At one point I saw a small silhouette of a woman, like a drawing but it only lasted about 5 seconds or so.  There were no drawings around me that look like that, so I don't think I was distracted by something outside of the monitor. The first image I saw was a forest of pine trees along the bottom of the screen, as if I was higher and looking down at them. Then I saw pine trees around the edges of the screen as if I was standing in a forest and looking up at the sky. Stars then appeared in the sky. After that, all the shapes I saw were stars and galaxies. I saw many spiral galaxies spinning relatively quickly. Most had a large bulge of bright light at the center. I saw some stars up close. I could make out the round outer rim of the star, as well as convective motion at the surface. the first image was a snake head with bared fangs but with full rows of teeth, then the image merged into a racoon. then after it disappeared just had simple shapes then a hammer going across the screen.  The first images i experienced were clouds going on for long stretched then opening up to a full moon that became the sun. Then, I saw mountains that shifted from side to side on my screen, it seemed like the images were shaking their way off the screen and into reality. The last images I saw were from the inside of a cave and moving further and further out of the cave into the sunlight. the first images were vaguely geometric, and then ""softened"" into the overlapping fish scale effect. those morphed into a ""fireplace""/inferno for a time, and when nothing concrete appeared, it began moving toward structures I could more easily recognize, ending with vertical cascades of words, in columns. when I stopped viewing, I could actually begin to read the words. (I am an avid reader, and lover of words, in general. I suspect my brain saw them as its last refuge. I'm going to try, again, tonight, in more isolation, and dark surroundings.) The first images were within a minute I think. It was an assortment of symmetrical squares almost like a kaleidoscopic image with 4 sides. Then the helix shapes showed up in the upper part of the screen, and was spinning. Then a rotating wheel like a ferris wheel that looked 3D for a few seconds, but repeated often. Then I was traveling down a long straight road with trees on either side, this was the only ""movement"" i experienced. Trees returned often for a few seconds at a time. There was a pink square object that floated across the screen several times, it did not have symmetrical form, it alternated between pink and blue. Between the trees and helix shapes i saw many rotating spheres like planetary systems, and some sprayed beams of light in every direction. These were fast moving and fleeting. I also saw what might be called neurons firing with arms of energy pulsating around them. Most of these images were not vivid enough to change color and stayed in the red/orange spectrum. The first minute or two was nothing then I started to see what seemed like cracks and lines. These turned to almost bird like shapes flying around the screen. At one point I felt like I was in space flying around a planet with rings and watching a sun explode as I flew around the rings. The next image was as if I were in the matrix complete with black and green color.  The first phase was flat geometric shapes - like a sparse hexagonal grid, writhing and changing shape. Then it appeared to rush toward me. Mostly like alternately moving forward and backward through a sci-fi 3-D hyperspace tunnel. Clouds and a starfield appeared. At first the movement was entirely radial, tunnel-like, but then a virtual horizon appeared and I saw structures below me and to the sides as though I had descended into a canyon rimmed by massive vertical walls that were made of non-aligned blocks. The first thing I noticed was the field separating into a grid. The grid gradually grew more complex, as though zooming out. Eyes started to appear, looking like how one would draw the eyes of an owl. They flashed in the middle. They were purple. Then they were at every intersection on the grid, then the grid was swirling and the eyes with it.

This gave way to more swirling patterns before text started to appear. It flashed onto the screen, fragments here and there. It was incomprehensible and oriented in four different directions. I recognised the Latin characters, and the font was similar to Helvetica, but that's about all I can tell. Some text was larger than other bits, and some more distinct than other bits. Some was black on red, some was black on white (or vice versa).

Numbers were gradually interleaved with the letters before replacing them entirely. In addition to the flashing, they scrolled across the screen in long lines like a stock ticker.

Then vivid flashes of images came. Bright, but brief. I saw a black and white drawing of a warrior with long hair. Then an animal's face, sinister with teeth bared. Then the number 4. Another animal's face (possibly the same one).

The animal faces made me feel uneasy, so I turned it off. According to the white noise track, I was three minutes in at this point. It was enough. As I type this, a lasting ghostly after-image lingers, like when you stare at a light. It's fuzzy and indistinct. The first thing I saw; It was like a vibrating cell in the center. I might even call it 'membrane'. Then I focused on the black shadows and saw the butterfly shadows kissing each other. It was on the whole screen. I saw geometric shapes all over the screen. It was more of a 'plus' form. There was also a perception that was moving rapidly inside a tunnel. Finally, the honeycomb took up the entire screen for a long time. The first thing that appeared were these simple bars of light (like neon lights), switching/flowing between different angles, sometimes vertical or horizontal, sometimes at a 45 degree angle. Sometimes they would meet as if forming the corner of a room and ceiling, giving a slight sense of depth and location. There were occasional flickers of something that would, inexplicably, make me think of a specific place or object, despite not being visually distinct enough to really ""see"" it--such as a dark mossy forest, or the outside of an old building in a city with the sky behind it. There were a couple moments of seeing a bright ""horizon line"", which reminded me of part of the old iTunes visualizer, and felt a bit like gazing down a digitally rendered room that stretched on infinitely. There was a part where I saw a sort of mobius loop of what seemed like dragon scales, rotating in front of me, where it was tipped up at a slight angle and I could see the front half moving one direction, and the back half moving the opposite way, partly obscured. The colors of the flashing light would also tend to change, sometimes showing vivid red and black splotches that were large and distinct, other times feeling more cyan/blue, or smaller patches of color, and there was even a moment where I saw a distinction between a more orange-red and a more magenta-red. Even the rate of flickering seemed to shift, sometimes seeming very rapid, and other times slowing down. The longest lasting visual I saw was this sort of v-shaped patch that would ""breathe"", shrinking in and then puffing back out in a consistent rhythmic fashion. I was almost able to form it into a ball sort of shape, but only for a moment. (This last one happened at the 10 minute mark, and I wasn't able to go back to it after looking away to restart the white noise.) None of these effects felt terribly vivid to me, but were present enough that I could put language to them. My mind's eye visuals are usually fairly strong (and in fact overlaid themselves atop the flashing once or twice, as I felt my attention span waning) but also not ""strictly visual"", if that makes sense (factoring in motion, facial and bodily expression, proprioception, and other senses). The effects of the flashing also seemed less distinct than my experiences with the sort of ""rainbow confetti"" CEVs I experience from taking psilocybin mushrooms (which are also distinct from my mind's eye visuals). The flash appeared to rotate at one point, as if it wasn't even. The ""centre"" of the flash started to oscillate for a while - rocking left to right around 2"" at arms length. Redness of the flash lessened into more of a black and white. ""Saw"" non-uniform patterns from time to time - which I liken to the rock face of a cliff. The flashing did not seem constant, and I saw the red turning orange at one point and the black would appear dark green sometimes.  The flicker appeared to form a poorly defined checkerboard like pattern of the red and black, with some blue. Behind/inside of the flicker spiral like shapes that appeared textural rather than flat, like swirling brushstrokes in oil paint, would pinwheel around. Eventually I saw what I would describe as lightly ethereal looking streamers of light at the outer edges of the monitor. Nothing, however, was any more defined or vivid than what I see ""in my minds eye"" when I stare at a solid color surface or close my eyes. The flicker felt uneven, sometimes it looked red more often, or black more often. I got a small circle in the middle of my vision (not the screen), which at one point seemed striped, like the circle was made of rainbow. Most of the time is was more like a pool where the color was shifted from the rest of the field. the flicker seemed to disappear at points and it looked like a dark blue night sky at times, when I blinked I saw yellow and black geometric shapes in different configurations, I saw black dots at various places on screen at about 7-8 minutes (just a guess on timing), I also saw faint moving outlines that seemed almost like a movie or scenery that I just couldn't quite make out, there were rolling waves of the red and black/blueish color fading in and out but at a slower speed than the flash and circular shaped The geometric shapes and lines began immediately and were followed by a simple butterfly and star pattern that started to get more detailed. Purple and white were the first other colors I saw, followed by hints of blue and green. From there I saw bursts of light and spinning, twisting distortions. The flashing began to move around the corners of my laptop as if it were coming out of the screen. It felt incredibly 3D and then I started to see outlines of objects, people, and buildings. I could not see faces or complete colored details, just strong outlines. First I saw a large shooting star and then the outline of a high rise building with windows. I also kept seeing the outline of a man in a wizard hat and cloak with stars. All of these things were shades of purple, blue, and pink. For some reason I started to feel weird at this point and glanced away for a second and when I looked back, the visuals were mostly gone except shapes and lines. Then the screen warping and twisting started again and made me feel a bit nauseous so I stopped. The image seemed to grow outside the screens boundaries and towards me. I saw white circles that moved in patterns and changed with every flicker. At one point, my mind briefly interpreted one of the shapes as a cartoon fish laughing. After a few minutes I saw tiny black dots.
 The images and environments were constantly changing as I left my mind to wander popping from one random idea to the next as if I was reading my own subconsciousness on the screen. The images started as “Spirograph” style circles that began rotating in both directions. They then began moving slowly around the visual field. They then turned into rotating daisy type flowers, some moved, others did not. After a couple minutes, they became very vidid five point stars that cartwheeled in both direction, some slow some fast. During most of the experience, I saw the colors black, red, blue, yellow, violet and lavender. After it was over, I still saw these shapes and colors faintly  in my visual field for a few minutes.  The images would change frequently. I saw large landscape, buildings, fireballs, constellations, zoos full of animals, crowded rooms of people.. The initial imagery was all just geometric shapes, mostly radially symmetrical, like crossed lines, circles, square tiling, which were there more or less constantly. This is also something I ""see"" somewhat frequently when going to sleep. Occasionally the colors would ""blend together"" and I would see more of a grey to light blue, completely blank screen (as if it wasn't even flashing at all). Other times it would appear as if a shadowy human-looking figure was standing there, no features just a silhouette. Also what looked like a long hallway with fluorescent lights in the corners, which looked like I was going down/forward, like on a rollercoaster. At the beginning I felt like I couldn't visualize anything on purpose, which was troubling/disturbing because I can normally visualize things very vividly, including scenery, objects, people, etc. Eventually I was able to visualize things again while still seeing these geometric patterns, but it was much more difficult than normal. I found this unsettling. The inside of a torus, Mickey Mouse, Batman, a skeleton, a butterfly, simple polyhedra (I specifically remember an octahedron), small dancing circles, a red disk with symbols on it (I think I pulled that from a memory one of the medallions in Ocarina of Time), The letter X and crosses, sometimes large swirls The lights began to rotate and warp. It felt like I could reach into the screen. Then it was like I was in a spaceship flying past hundreds of stars and planets. Then it was like I was falling towards this ornate floor. And I was looking at this cathedral with pillars and statues and many colours. And there was a forest and move and it then morphed into this stormy ocean. And got so intense I decided to stop after 3 minutes. The main flashing color would switch from red to a deep teal or dark green every couple of seconds. I saw a lot of orbs (the orbs were outlined, not solid shapes) in the center of the screen that were backlit, with a halo effect around the orb. I saw a great many diagonal shapes flashing, some of them traveling from, for example, the top left of the screen down to the bottom right, or from top right to bottom left. Sometimes there were two at once, like an ""X."" The Xs ranged in size from the entire height of my computer screen to small ones in the center of the screen, inside one of the orbs. But I would only see one X at a time, never multiples. About three-quarters of the way through, I felt myself involuntarily pulling back from the screen, as it seemed to be too much visual stimulus (I get tired in the laundry section of the grocery store from all the garish colors.) EVERY color I saw was artificial and not really found in nature, and that was offensive to my mind's eye. At one point I saw rings rotating (like the rings around Saturn). Sometimes they were in rainbow colors. Sometimes the diagonal lights were in rainbow colors, but really bright neon colors that you wouldn't see in a real rainbow. The majority was geometric shapes, mostly hexagon/honeycomb. It was all black and red. Midway it started to look like a time lapse of the night sky, with stars whirling across the screen very quickly. It felt like a scene in one of those movies where a character is on a spacewalk and loses control, and the camera shows space spinning wildly around them. At some point near the end I could kind of see crazy buildings that made no sense. If you've seen those AI generated landscapes, where it superimposes other random objects very quickly onto parts of the image, it was very similar to that. This part was not very clear though. And even when I could see the stars and the surreal building, the geometric shapes were still onscreen just out of focus.  The more I focused while tuning everything else out as much as was possible, including the rest of my laptop, the more intense the 'frequency' became. It felt like if I'd kept the focus on my screen as much and with the same intensity as I'd had it at the time, I would have felt being pulled inside the experience even more. The visuals kept oscillating between colours; red got replaced by flashing grey, silver, black, etc at times. At one point for a brief duration, perhaps 3-4 seconds, everything stopped and became a shiny grey. Amongst the most fascinating 10 minutes of my life for sure, and really wonder how it would impact the field of psychology, as I personally have been dealing with a rather distressing few weeks, and this perhaps was the one 10-minute window where I've felt something close to peace. PS - I did this right after a 10-minute session of Headspace. Hope it helps. The most common image for me was something out of a time warp sequence with walls appearing and disfiguring and reappearing in different directions. Also an image of spiraling down a circle, then back up. As I watched more it seemed like curved lines would 'whip' across the screen The most memorable, though weak, image was of looking up from the ground and seeing grass towering above. Besides that, mostly the geometric images. Towards the 10 minute mark it began to seem as if the screen was 3d, curving inwards. Sometimes it seemed as though images were going to appear and my mind wanted to see them, but then it would go away. The most predominant memory is of the vortices. No matter what was coming up, sooner or later, a vortex (sometimes more than one) would start, somewhere usually to the upper half of my field of view. Sometimes they would be small (the beginning of the experience I saw smaller ones, but they were larger the longer I viewed), but towards the end they would span the whole of the screen. One time it was like rushing down a curving tunnel.

I saw geometric shapes early on - fairly regular diamond shapes (well, like squares turned corner-up). They appeared to be yellow. The earliest shape that wasn't a vortex or a square diamond was a fanged mouth (I know!), or possibly the eyes. I had one go and saw very little then started again with the screen expanded and sitting back, that was more vivid immediately. The fanged mouths moved and seemed to bite, or sometimes shout and scream. The eyes were close together - the faces they were in were quite distant. They weren't friendly either - sometimes developing into slightly clichéd demonic figures with outspread arms. A few times the fanged mouths turned out to belong to roaring bears.

After a while I started getting glimpses of a forest, and I *really* wanted to see that forest. I would feel really frustrated every time it faded, like I hadn't ""accessed"" the right level yet? Something like that. Sometimes the yellowish lines would develop into something like a pyramid, one time with an eye in it! The forest would reoccur, though, and more like viewing the tops of the trees against a sunset/ twilight sky.

The straight lines were yellow, outlined in red, and the mouths were whiteish, the vortices and eyes light purplish.

Because I'm synaesthetic, there was also a texture component, though I'm unsure whether that was from the white noise or the visual elements. Oh, and the white noise started developing coherent elements as well - sometimes snatches of music, other times like wailing voices. There was a definite Souls In Purgatory theme developing!

The imagery was quite compelling, but I felt like I knew where I was most of the time. Sometimes I'd literally pinch myself, or close my eyes for longer than a normal blink (though part of this was because my eyes were starting to dry out) to deliberately dispel the imagery (though part of me was irritated by ""having to start again""). All of it looked/ felt like it was behind a barrier, though the light did start spreading out beyond the screen quite quickly.

The longer I started without moving or blinking my eyes, the more vividly the images came. It reminded me of when I was a kid and I used to stare fixedly at inanimate objects/ my own unmoving reflection until stuff started to appear to shift of its own accord.  The most prominent images were of space with thousands of stars and galaxies. It seemed like I was moving and spinning really slowly through space there was a variety of colors in these like purple, white, blue, yellow, red, black, and a little green. I also saw deep blue lakes and ponds being rained on, with many different rings on the waters surface from the individual raindrops. Those were the two most real scenes that kept reappearing but I also saw a lot of geometric things like lines and circles, that would spin quickly and shoot out towards me like they were coming out of the screen. I didn't hear anything besides the static of the white noise. the most vivid image were morphing/ondulating gears, and large cityscapes, constantly changing color, with the left half of the screen being filled with fine static noise which would move in and out. faces would show up in the center in intervals. The most vivid thing I saw were eyes, from different perspectives at different stages of blinking, and of different sizes, about 10 times. They appeared near my point of focus and would drift off the screen as if floating down a river. Sometimes a pair of lips was mixed in as well. Their vividness was the quality of the memory of a photo-realistic drawing, but without the extra colors. I saw birds (hawk or raven-esque) about 5 times when I was staring at the center of the screen.The perspective was mostly looking at them from the front while they were in flight. The center of the screen became their beaks, and their wings extended to either side of the screen and appeared to be flapping in slow motion. The vividness of this was more of a shadow, like when a light behind something is so bright that you can only make out it's silhouette and minor details. I saw a lot of galaxy-ish formations that would form from globs of speckles and spin off screen. I frequently saw shadows of figures like those wooden dolls that artists use to model human stances, and a sort of ""worm hole"" in the center of the screen. The screen frequently looked like it was getting closer to or farther from me, or like it was bending inwards at the edges. I tried to hold an image of a plane in my head to see if that would influence what I saw, and similar shapes would flash on screen, but nothing fully formed. The numbers 5 and 7, a spinning wheel, different colors, arrowhead, all vague, faint. Also had a feeling of movement, like I was watching a video camera pan down a hallway or through space The only persisting image I saw was a wheel or circle spinning very quickly. I could only see a portion of it, about a quarter in the top right hand corner of the screen. It was getting quicker and quicker the more intensely I focused on it. Other than that I didn't see any clear images, I just got the impression of rapid movement across the screen at other points. The overall impression of the screen was of shapes like wide paintbrush-strokes being randomly reapplied a couple of dozen times every second. The colors of these images varied from pink through red and orange, shifting into purple sometimes. There was a secondary category of images that overlaid the above, and were less intense. These were hundreds of small blue/green dots that seemed to have patterns to them, and that moved rapidly, mostly in whirlpool-like spirals around the center of my focus. They shifted between clockwise and counterclockwise motion. Sometimes the dots seemed to be framed, so that each of them was within a hole in a grid of fine orange lines, but still constantly in motion. I noticed that if I closed either eye, the open eye would see the dots no longer spinning, but instead seeming to move towards me like a ""starfield"" screen-saver, and combined with the fine grid they took on the appearance of old-fashioned molecule models. Switching eyes would have the effect of flipping the screen left-to-right. The experience did not change much from the first minute to the last, I would say. The patterns I saw were basically the sorts of patterns you might experience in a certain kind of video game or music visualization - lots of distortions, wormhole effects, shifting geometric shapes, rotating honeycomb shapes, part of the screen rotating counterclockwise as another part of the screen rotated clockwise, sunburts. I started seeing these effects pretty early on in watching the ganzflicker, and I felt like one sort of ""effect"" would change into another sort of effect after a few seconds, so the exact effect I was seeing kept shifting. It really did remind me a lot of music visualizations and video game backgrounds. I also perceived the lines on the screen at times as splitting into a faint rainbow, as if you had put water on a tv screen and could see the red/green/blue subpixels magnified. The pope as a cartoon side image (I'm not Catholic), a forest, lightning, a field, geometric shapes. the rectangular screen started to morph around from the first second on, kind of ""liquidy"" changed its form as time continued to more rounder shapes. from time to time i started to see a little circle right in the middle of the screen. the circle slowly changed to the shape of the letter ""6"", then slowy after disappeared, just to come back and change to ""4"" while the whole screen still appeared to change its rectangular form to rounder shapes.  while thats happening, sometimes the screen colour changing apppeared to be blue for a few seconds here and there. The red color stayed pretty consistent, but I would have sworn the black was different shades of blue and sometimes green. When I blinked, there would be a brief second where a circle appeared in the screen and the colors somehow radiated from that. The pattern of the flickering changed a lot, seeming to speed up or develop rhythms. Shapes became more complex as time went on. I saw a lot of ghost movement in the bottom half of the screen. The red flashing of the screen looked like it was popping out at me after staring for about 7-8 minutes, fuzzy but flowing geometric shapes were moving and shifting around the screen constantly but I was definitely trying to see more complex figures and objects, which may ultimately have caused there to be less results in my field of vision as I was focusing inside my mind The red was incredibly frustrating/anger-inducing. I would recommend trying with black and white colors that don't already have an emotional / cultural subconscious correlation.  I get this effect when I close my eyes and lightly put my fingers on my eyelids.  I do this as a light pressure / distraction / calming technique at the onset of a headache in hopes of disrupting it. First noticed this sensation as a child under the age of 5. The screen always seemed like it was bouncing. It switched back and forth between having weird lines (usually appearing pink, teal, or yellow), and concentric shapes (usually triangles). The first things I noticed (almost immedietly) were the words 'Colonel' and 'Freezer'. A minute later, the word 'STOP' appeared, this one had a clearly noticeable font that was large and with sans. The letters had a white outline, and whitish stripes going from bottom left to top right. The word 'TWIN' was more yellowish, though most of the others were just a vague discoloration that I can't describe very well, although most of them appeared to be in a font with sans (the letter G was the only one without sans, and I couldn't really decide if it was actually a G or just a thin yellow swirl). 'wethepeople' was in a very bold/fat font, with letters as wide as they were tall. The letters were also all smushed together. Throughout my time watching the Ganzflicker, I also saw eyes (which moved about the screen and occasionally blinked), a shape similar to the pokemon Espeon, and deer antlers. The screen felt like it was moving around a lot. Most of the distortion looked like the spirals I previously described or like sine waves, radio waves, or simply oscillating lines that would morph and bend into the spirals. Time definitely felt distorted. It is incredible how much time is linked to our vision constantly continuing our conscious perception. The 10 minutes went by very quickly. The screen looked like it was melting/fluid, then eventually swirled into a drain.  I blinked and it turned into webbing/ice.  For the last couple of minutes I found it very easy to visualize myself elsewhere (generally in outer space) but didn't feel like I had been transported anywhere. The screen rotated, shifted upwards and downwards, and there were lots of random patterns and images of various colors appearing and morphing. Blinking would temporarily reduce the intensity but once I looked at it for another 10-15 seconds the original intensity would return. The screen seemed to be growing and shrinking. I kept seeing blue and white boxes. The colors seemed to change from red to white to blue to black. Near the end I saw ellipses that turned into circles The screen seemed to bubble and pulse toward me like a frothing ocean of red pustules. I constantly felt as if it was mere seconds from encompassing my entire vision. It had a distinctly spatial quality to it that I normally have to work to generate, I could feel it coming closer as well as see it. The edges of the screen began to undulated, ebbing and flows inward and outward in red/black waves that gave the entire picture a shaking and unstable quality, it was almost as if the monitor was edging itself toward me with left-right-left-right hops. the screen shifted in size it seemed to became smaller or larger, the laptop also changed in size as well it seemed to be shifting. random color patterns that melded with one another   The screen started to look like it was shrinking and then expanding.  I saw cylinder shapes on the periphery that would morph or move around the edges.  I saw a small light colored circle in the center that was slowly moving in a circular pattern. The screen warped and folded then I began to see shapes moving around the room The screen was bubbling like red lava The screen was part of the apartment, and the taskbar was a window from which I was looking outside, there's a man going to the left of the screen, he's red and not in previous scene, there's a rotating square in the center of the screen, its turning, there's a path, in front of the house which is the rotating square, people are moving in circles left to right and they move faster, it has only been 3:48 but it feels like a lot. I am very stoned at the moment. The screen would spin alot, sometimes it would go faster. Sometimes it went through a train tunnel, sometimes through space hole things. It would fly through space and stars would fly past, no planets though. The shape of a timer (one triangle on the bottom with another inverted triangle on top) and then red or black ball in the centre where the tips of the two triangles meet The shapes got more detailed as a I kept looking at my screen. At first, it was just alternating colors red and black and then it became grey / green. After, I started to see circles dancing across the screen then the circles joined to create a stick person. The stick person then became a clown face. "

There were also scenes of zombies and demons and creatures (I am a horror fan, I liked it), a few scenes that seemed pulled from games I play that felt very real, a few made me sense movement, like I was moving very fast. Most was fractal images, one that stuck was of a robbed figure with a lantern that became a circle of 20ish copies of that person, and a lot of shapes that sometimes moved and ""became"" akin to animated characters, like they were alive. The sun in the sky, straight geometric lines curving into simple fractals The thing that amused me was the ability to change the direction and forms of patterns that I have perceived. Sometimes I wanted it to be circular, square or arrows.. it was like a paper that I could draw whatever I think on it. I even make some patterns with my finger beside my body and the pattern changed the way I moved my finger. The top halves of faces (specifically eyes). Spiral patterns like a spiderweb and a moving pinwheel. I also would see the silhouette of a city skyline at the bottom of the screen. Also saw tree branches The visual phenomena felt similar to that of a grid illusion, though less constrained than simply dots at an intersection. The most common image I saw was an X, I believe within a circle, similar to a Phillips head screw, with the X oriented with the perimeter forming a square with each corner towards a corner of my monitor. Usually the X lines were brighter and the circle was dark. I also saw something resembling an oval or egg with a vertical line and two shorter horizontal lines separating the vertical line into thirds. I also saw something resembling vertical strips and a grid, particularly at the beginning or when refocusing. Sometimes I saw a circular starburst-type of movement. There appeared a long hallway with painted white walls that were a little bit reflective. At the end of the hall, I saw a being walk past the doorway, back up, then just stand there. In a flash, he was standing at the end of the hall and a bit to the left and appeared to be looking at me. He would periodically move closer to me and then be back at the far end of the hall. Eventually, another like him was also there.     This was a very strange feeling.  There appeared to be an aura around the periphery. there was a chess board on the screen, brown and white. there were many random pieces being moved everywhere. There was a constant line moving upwards that would reset to the bottom of the screen once it reached the top. Faintly I could see almost like a skeleton shape behind the moving line. The skeleton seemed human and was the chest area, very symmetrical.  There was a large white ""X"" that repeatedly came at me frequently.  Also a large dark pair of eyes.  Large star shape came at me There was a line running parallel to the top/bottom of monitor on left, which plunged into a almost 45* angle to another perpendicular line, lower, but to the right side. This ""Z"" pattern, if you will, moved up an down throughout it. there was a lot of geometric shapes/ kaleidoscopic images. Depending on what I thought about the image would change. At one point I could see the milky way  There was a starfish in royal robes waving some kind of sword, at other parts there were series of tunnels the were leading up to some bright object, there was a a tree that seemed to appear up from the bottom of the screen, then melt apart. A large, dozen-fingered hand reached down from above and picked up a pile of scrap metal. Each of these were intermittent among persistent images of fractals and other geometric shapes. There was an intense moment about 3 minutes in where I saw several scenes, about 3 seconds each, very cinematic, first a windmill (camera swooping dramatically from below), then a few other things that I don’t recall, then ended with a phalanx (camera swooping dramatically across the tips of spheres) There was an overlapping vortex with the rotation going clockwise and counterclockwise simultaneously while the center of the screen became a funnel in which the screen seemed to be coming at me while also spinning.  After about a minute of this I saw complete geometric shapes superimposed on the vortex that would change rapidly.  Some of the shapes had an organic living feel to them.  After about 2 minutes more complex images like a whale swimming across the screen emerged.  I also saw a large bat and what I felt looked like a bicycle.  Each of these things were moving across the screen in different directions and never at the same time.  Geometric shapes would manifest while these images occurred, but as a background while these moved on the forefront. There was many parallel lines (lozenges in orange, brown, pink, blue) flowing outside the screen; sometimes a black shape in the middle of the screen, like a bug or a microorganism in 2D. All images was moving. There was this bird, almost like a Native American symbol, rising up from the SE corner that was blue and gold, looking down on a man in armor with his back to me holding a sword. Another was a space station—futuristic and circular, with ships flying in and out like a port, then eventually meteors crashing into it. I also kept seeing various images of knights and soldiers—war and fighting. Not sure why. Maybe the red? There wasn't anything at first. But then I saw a very beautiful green and then an elusive blue. Then after a bit there was this wavy white line like the aurora borealis there were a few times that it looked like there was something behind the red/black:  a screen of green characters; fly wings; insects There were a lot of shapes around the outside and what looked like an animal head in the middle, they all moved and faded in and out, spun around. The black turned to blue and red faded to almost grey. There were a lot of tearing within the flickers that would lead to me seeing things like lines and shapes and colors.  Eventually I would see movement from the flickering that wasn't static, like going through a tunnel or a spiral.  They felt like I was in 3D space, but they weren't fully defined.  A lot of traveling at fast speeds, surrounded by white and blue highlights that travelled opposite of me. there were a lot of weird shapes, often squares jumping accross the screen like those bouncing dvd logo things, also at one point the screen seemed to be filling with red slowly from the top. I also saw some white squares and stuff, and a few times the red and black would turn into the pattern of trees and flowers There were amorphous sort of opposing color regions - the flickering was red and black, but the regions that came up were dark bluish and were with rounder borders than the rectangular screen I was looking at. There seemed to be the odd lines and shapes within these regions - I didn't particularly enjoy looking at this. There were constant distortions from the beginning where the edges of the screen bulged and 'breathed', with some rocking back and forth.  Angular lines that were mostly emanating from the centre of the screen were visible often, which created other lines that could make them similar to spiderwebs. The centre of the screen was often a pulsing ball of light but nowhere else.  The screen pulses often looked blue, green, and yellow in addition to black and red.  Rarely I saw figures in the Ganzflicker, but I don't know if I would call them 'complex', it was more like they were simplified humanoids. There were fractal images that would form into a more complex image. I remembera face, an old building with a steeple, and a desolate/crumbling city block. Each image lasted for a few seconds then a ""burst"" would appear when I blinked of either Neon Purple or Neon Green and the fractal image would flow again. There were mostly shifting patterns of vague shapes and colors, somewhat like a kaleidoscope. For a brief time I saw fairly distinct honeycomb patterns across the whole screen.  There were overlapping layers of text continually coming towards me, alongside other written and typed materials like mathematical formula. Sometimes other images began to form and then faded out. Twice, small circles with photographic images appeared at the top of the screen, just to the right. I couldn't tell exactly what was inside but it looked like a scene of some kind.  There were rows of eyes and the would change the pattern of their movements there were shivering flower like patterns (sometimes they were geometrical) that are constantly changing their flows, sides and rhytms. When I looked at the center for a while I saw a white light and growing lines around it. Towards the end of the 10 min I saw rainbows. There were simple patterns - swirling geometric shapes mainly. Then, there was depth, as if there was an entire room behind my screen. A kind of arm-like appendage with three prongs at its end began swaying in the room, reaching towards me. This was replaced with a large drill that was also approaching. Finally, the drill was replaced with a misshapen orb that continued to approach. The images then dissolved into more geometric shapes, with flashes of blue and yellow. Directing my attention to the corners of the screen, splashes of rectangles would launch across the rest of my visual field. There were simple patterns that swirled around into shapes and some faces ""bouncing"" in the corners of the screen. At one point i closed my eyes to see what it looked like but didnt realize they were slowly opening again and as they did, it looked like waht you see when you record your screenrecorder and see infinite screens. There were tiny birds flying in a synchronized and mirror image form to form a huge butterfly shape. I became one of them for a moment. It was changing very fast. One evening with heavy rain and thunder, I was walking into a cafe with huge windows on the road. It was happening over and over again. Traveling on a plane or  A quick ride in the ocean at light speed. And İt was something like all of that. there where flower outline shapes floating. then it morphed to my prespective, i was sitting in a very worn down city, on a ledge of a building.   They are coming for us. They will spare none. The shapes started simple then branched into complex. At first it was like 4 quadrants of squares, then a thick border separated the quadrants, then that border had a hexagon at every corner. That image then changed as I got spooked, and it became stars with many points and sometimes faces. 
Sometimes I saw blue, sometimes I'd visualize uncomfortable things, but the imagery I was seeing never became those uncomfortable things.
I had some comfort knowing it would only last 10 minutes. storm clouds bringing rain and lightening then white clouds bringing cleansing rain At first I saw this constant quick rotating black blur that kept going around and around the screen quickly. There were also parts that kept shutting (as if I was quickly opening my eyes and closing them, or as if shutting a laptop and opening it quickly over and over again). I guess I could describe it as two black parabolas morphing into each other and un-morphing quickly. It got really aggressive in some parts and it made me uncomfortable. Then I saw my computer screen getting bigger and bigger almost as if the red screen was enlarging, but I wasn't getting closer, this happened a lot when I stopped blinking for a while. It was only when I was blinking that that didn't happen. Sometimes I saw an outline of my computer screen, like a yellow border around but more so floating and undetached from my screen. I also saw a one point perspective landscape but it was barren, almost like a desert, and there was a road (I could see the two yellow lines on the center of the road). Afterwards, I saw an outline of a grey mask towards the bottom right of my screen but it wasn't a face, it was more like a full face mask with a space for eyes and a space for the mouth (kind of like The Flash's cowl in the tv show on The CW). Towards the end I started seeing zig zag lines of yellow, magenta/hot pink/purple, and orange each directly next to each other and following the same path. At first I saw a mountain forming in the middle of the screen, which then started erupting like a volcano. The lava then starting flowing and filling the screen and forming other images. I saw a lot of patterns, like the ones on certain types of tiles. These morphed and changed and I had the images of mountains and the volcano come back at several points. It wasn't quite the kind of vivid that real landscapes would be, but more vivid like a cartoon or caricature drawing. I saw a lot of blue and purple. From beginning the ganzflicker I saw a green spiral beginning in the center of the screen, that spiraled outward until it covered the entire screen, like I was looking through a tunnel. Inside the spiral I began to see a series of shapes in alternating red and green lines. The shapes lasted a few seconds and morphed from one shape to the next, all beginning in the center of the screen and expanding outward to fill the whole screen. Shapes included: various lines (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal), zigzags, triangles, boxes, alphabetic letters (V, X, Z, I), and outlines (basic house shape in particular). Shapes and colors were continuous for the entirety of the experiment until I exited the ganzflicker.  first, it was a vortex that transformed into a large diamond pattern crossing all over the screen, which became cross-hatches, which turned into a web-like structure. The web splintered off into various sections which floated away from each other. Then I saw orbs and shadows appearing and disappearing. A few times, it seemed like something was moving across the screen or in and out of frame, like a figure as a reflection from behind me. From the moment it began I saw the constant zig zagging of the red ball. It would be wiping down the screen like a rapid widow washer, to up and down. over and over this rapid pattern, then a heart at the center of the screen convulsing with outlining hearts, then a series of patterns again. The strangest thing, was that for about four minutes, two separate times, I heard music playing, a looped bass guitar, fitting the pattern in front of me. It was so real I removed an ear on my head phone twice because I believed I was picking up music from elsewhere in the house, there was none. A black cross that appeared in my central eye line. They were all simple geometric patterns like grids and distorted checkerboards They were circular, like flowers. and interconnected. They had sections around a central round section like slices of pie and the sections were opening and closing. There were several layers of these sections that moved out to join the next ""flower"". They were all opening and closing simultaneously in rhythm They were skeletons digging. thick neon lines moving really fast around the screen and dots. mostly in a yellow green colour and a little bit of blue thick spiderweb type pattern over the flickering screen thin geometric shapes, flashes, points (in the center the points) 
Mostly colors: red, lot of red, some yellow, some green and much blue actually petrol blue (I believe this is how you call it in English) not black actually Thin wispy vertical lines and spiderwebs on the outer edges of the rectangle Things things that sweeping in the screen Things would start to partially form then fade back out. Doorway at the end of a long tunnel with trees outside of it. Maybe faces, figures starting to form. Sometimes movement. Structures with straight or angular lines. This reminds me of the lucia lights but less intense. Started off seeing almost negative shapes. About 2 mins in a saw a cross then a triangle shape. Geometric shapes would pass to right then to the left. If i stared into and attempted to see beyond flashing white and red shapes, i would see people and action scenes and landscapes. three dimenional objects, faces, lots of colors, a big bird, numbers and letters on top of my screen, small animals running beow my screen, but also stuff that scared me like a sword that seemed to be coming out of the screen pointet on me held by something that scares me. Three distinct, repeating events: (1) a deep, peacock blue infiltrating the red, to greater and lesser degrees; (2) colorless expanding waves in my left peripheral vision (at highest frequency they took about 3 seconds to expand and fade and repeated about 2 seconds later); (3) narrow strips of solid black that appeared first in the upper left corner, then in the upper right corner, then across the bottom, each time lasting a few seconds.   Note: I experience infrequent (once or twice a year at most) migraines, aura only.  The aura almost always occurs on the left side of my field of vision and has a sharper, more pulsing quality than the waves I had seen with the Ganzflicker.  The Ganzflicker waves did not pulse, but expanded outward and faded away; they also showed much lower contrast than my aura does. Tigers, human blur faces Tile like patterns. Fractal hexagonal tiles where some of the tiles had the pattern repeating within them. Also subway tiles where alternate rows were moving in opposite directions. Also, somewhat circular shape rotating counter clockwise. Nothing I would label as a hallucination. Looked more like blocking artifacts from compressed video or something else we're trained to filter out. Tiny flashes of lightening, complex cells within complex shapes  too much and to hard to put into words Too much variety to describe more than a few discrete images in much detail. Most images were faint and ephemeral but others persisted for a few seconds and can be played back in my mind. Occasionally saw what looked like spiraling galaxies with distinct white stars (otherwise everything was red). Also saw repeating simple shapes, though more often randomly morphing kaleidoscope-like patterns. A frequent starting form of an image looked like ripples on a pond. Once, the ripples appeared to segment (like pizza slices). The segmented ripples began rapidly rotating about the ripples' origins and intersecting with each other in perfect synchrony, like ceiling fans close enough together for the blades to collide but instead meshing like gears. Tornadic twisting, circular spinning, faint firework flashes of blue filling the whole screen, a vertical straight light line moving back & forth across the screen, crisscrossing pattern moving across screen, brightness of red shifting between very light red and very dark red, flashes of full black screen. Tornado
Heads  Trapazoid Traveling down a stone corridor that lead to three tunnels; a movie reel that flickered down the screen, looking out a train window at a countryside Traveling through a wormhole like in Stargate, ice crystals forming and expanding, waves and ripples, the screen expanding to fill my entire vision, and the appearance of something deeper in the screen but hidden.  Traveling through space, creation of stars. Tree branches and geometric shapes in the upper third of the screen.  They seemed to be more apparent if I blinked rapidly. Trees in the distance. A dock - like a pier. Lines - similar to the ones in the palm of a hand.  trees, lines, balls, firework explosion, path Trees, striations, grids, eyes, faces, maybe buildings (those were quick), and some images I couldn't detail or interpret, but I could see. Lots of color changes: purple, yellow, orange, blue, green flashed once.  trees/ forest, rainy, dark, shadowy, flashing emergency lights, like looking through a review mirror  tress , paw prints, letters, tentacles  triangle， cross lines， geometrical figure Triangle, Square, Circle and some planets Triangles triangles diagonal lines and circles Triangles in center, swirls at edges. Yellow and purple. triangles,  stars shooting from side to side , grids tried to see castles, saw them. see skulls, saw them. its like you can imprint whatever on it even knowing no one else will ever see it Tthe red/back gave way to other colors, there was no other imagery except the 'cracks', which I'd equate to the reflection of capillaries in the retina reflected. Tunneling. It was just flickering at first and then it started turning into a tunnel. Like I was walking inside of it. I didn’t want to see what was in it. I turned it off.  tunnels and rotating lines and spheres and ripples and explosions and I think an eye at one point and lots of blue red green and yellow tunnels of light resembling the warp drive from Star Wars, balls of light, spider webs, geodesic shapes tunnels, close ups of monkey faces, gas masks, insects, a few scenes with bicycles or trains Tunnels, eyes, faces, animals, roads/paths, sky, birds. Tunnels, morphing like a living thing. My head started to hurt. Turbines going across the screen. Checkered boards, fireworks balls bouncing TV noise. But background red + flash Twirling, twisting geometric/radial patterns were constantly changing, morphing, and appearing on screen.  Two balls of light Two circles rounding Two dark balls, one on top, the other on the bottom just touching the top one. Two distinct flashing balls of light at the top and bottom of the screen, and three times a thin vertical line of white light moved from the far left to the center (where the dots of flashing light were) and disappeared. two intersecting lines (""+"" shape) -> 4 intersecting lines (""+"" overlayed with ""x"" shape) -> grid shape with ""stars"" then appearing at intersections all over, very ""sparkyly"". A central bright unfilled circle -> two misaligned semicircles -> an ""eye"" shape with top and bottom halves laterally offset and a single spiralling arm extending from the outer end of each segment. Curving streams of light diagonally across the screen becoming wider and gaining texture into a wavy ""tube"" shape which opened out at one end, perspective apparently moving along this shape to the wide end at which point flash of light and return to grid of bright sparkly stars with central two-offset-semi-circles motif. At this point I got bored and stopped watching estimate 5 minutes. Two tall walls on either side of me like a tunnel.  The walls then move past me like I'm walking forward.  Then everything feels disorienting as I continue through the tunnel.  Eventually it turns right, and I have small moments throughout that make me feel disoriented and anxious.  The 'tunnel' or 'maze' seems to be spinning like I'm inside a moving building.  Near the end the walls move past faster, like I'm rushing through it at a faster pace, with the feeling of disorientation and anxiousness rising up.  I suppose I was stuck in some kind moving/shifting maze.  At one point there were doors I passed, but I did not go into them although I had an urge to try.

I don't view it like I would see right now.  It's more like I'm having a mild dream in the midst of when I'm slowly starting to wake up. typical psychedelia  Typical visual ""strobing"", limited to the screen. Light blue and dark blue instead of black. Looked like the way movies portray the process of switching bodies (going through this weird tube thing like on That's So Raven). I saw impressions of the way audio tracks are visualized (google audio track clip art).
I also saw several horizon lines. First, the silhouette of a pine forest at night. During this I saw a tiny, faint moon rise and fall. Then I saw a shadowy apple move across the screen. I saw the trees maybe twice more, the last time including their reflection on a lake. I also saw the ocean horizon. All of this was pretty faint, though.  Unfocused, I saw rotating and morphing geometrical patterns, rotating purple and gold galaxies, balls of light.

Focusing, I saw pretty much whatever I could think of.  At one point in time, I saw myself going down a waterslide and actually could feel the twists and turns.   Upside down buildings; cargo ships Us"

Vague rainbow shapes, mostly circles and diamonds. At one point, I did see what looked like an illustration of flames as well. Vague sphere of non strobing light Various color streaks ranging from light blue to brown. They were not static but in constant movement. Screen was like looking at a blurry sepia tone. Various color streaks ranging from light blue to brown. They were not static but in constant movement. Screen was like looking at a blurry sepia tone. various maving lines and rotating objects. I had recurring images of a railroad track. Faces that changed very quickly. Various shades of blue/turquoise, green/ yellow-green in addition to red and black. 

Widening and narrowing of periphery with dark ""overlay"" strips that shifted from translucent to solid and back along a gradient.

Simple moving shapes, spheres, spirals,  wavy lines, etc. Varying geometric patterns, very chaotic and constantly moving and changing. Straight lines rotating, spiral ""galaxy"" disks, moving triangular patterns, moving circular patterns, etc. Varying patterns of light and streams of light across the screen. Vertical and horizontal lines in blue, white and black. Jagged zigzag edges at the edges of my view of the screen. A white glow in the centre with a sense of explosion outside that. The screen broke up into graininess and then rough squares of blue, white, red and black.
My vision seemed to be looking very deeply into the screen with the images often very far away. Vertical animated sin waves along lateral edges.  Vertical quick pulse of lights from one end to the other of the screen, which after a while gives the feel of a single bolt of lightning running down. The shining endpoints of spokes in a rapidly rotating wheel that shifts from being viewed almost edgewise to something like 45 degrees (but never directly from the front). Cascading flickers of a series of connected spiderwebs (or starfishes with many arms). Various squares spread out in some sort of regular pattern that grows/changes size as the screen flickers. 

All of the image are generally faint/not that clear. Watched for five minutes before concluding that it's not going to change much from this and stopped watching. Very beautiful.calming.much depth.wanted to let myself go for longer very bismuth looking geometric shapes in roping chains coming out and around. some sort of weird monster thing with an open mouth that turned into more geometric shapes that were green and yellow and blue chains and then the colour shifted from bright red to very dark red and it kinda scared me so I clicked off  Very dreamlike, as when one is on the cusp of sleep and assorted images begin to float through the mind. I saw faces, both real and cartoon, complex oscillating geometric patterns, and at one point a realistic ice cream cone. Very little indeed. Was expecting more reaction. At first there were simple shapes - circles and triangles.  But after a while there was nothing. Very little. Just the occasional colour other than red and black. Very rapidly changing ""morphing"" geometric shapes, crosses, balls of light, spirals, tunnels Very, very faint impressions of circles and lines, eventually fading to a blue cast Visual static solidifying into geometric and abstract organic shapes interacting with each other behaving as if they were subject to gravity, perspective, and generally exhibiting radial symmetry Vivid colors other than red and black with vague geometric patterns (networks of circles) Vortices, spinning tops, butterflies flapping wings, tunnels, spinning Chakra wheels Walking through a garden with stone walls. Warm, vivid colours. Imagery. In the center of the screen. was like flying through the  cosmos, circular shapes rotating and spinning. They looked like they were made of stars or ice crystals. All was white on red. The flickering was annoying and gave the experience an mildly unpleasant strobe effect.  Wasnt it originally red and black?  Because it changed to orange and black.  I saw repeating shapes in a beat pattern...same pattern...same amount of time goes by.  Wasn't much at first just small blocks of colors such as blue, green and yellow but the blocks were in sections like a grid and all the colors were in each box. Then I started seeing things I saw before in video games, movies, shows, nature, etc that was pretty cool. After that I stopped. Watched for just less than 4 minutes.  No substantial images formed mostly a flickering of geometric shapes.  Although the most concrete imagery for myself started not long after beginning and was the shape of a corridor, similar to a simple forced perspective drawing.

Although before ending I did have a more block like image flash similar to joined Terri's blocks. But it only appeared on the lower end of tablet screen when my eyes involuntarily  moved. Water droplets hitting a still pond, insects, plants, horizontal and vertical bisecting lines of color and energy wavering moonlight on the ocean in the dark Waves emanating from the sides of the screen. Spinning discs of light or dark. Dark or light spots moving quickly in circles. Ripples all over the screen. Pulsing rainbow colors. Bright red or orange around the borders of the screen.  waves, crosses and spirals, the spirals were rotating and at one point i felt like i could make them change their rotation waves, ocean, flying over the city, walking at home, doors webbed shapes zomming in, buildings, snakes/dragons, rollar coaster ride, balls of light and dark webs with circles emanating from whichever place on the screen I focused on, there were green dots in a grid and white lines with faint blue going over the webs. The lines didn't seem to follow any pattern and drifted around Webs, shapes, lines, numbers, dots, triangales, shadows Weird eyes, dragons spiralling across the screen, strange but intricate patterns around the edge of the screen, a green fire thing along the edges of the screen whenever I blinked, rainbows, strange patterns and shapes, screen getting bigger and bigger until it fully consumed my vision for a few seconds, the room started shaking, heard waves briefly and also random songs Weird moving shapes with beams and balls of light of blue and red in colour what appeared to be my own face reflected,but with my one single eye in middle of my forehead. What I picture sound waves to look like-geometric undulating changing waves What I remember seeing was the constant flashes of the red and blacks lights then a human shape no distinct features ,  started appearing , at first seemed like it was being spread (legs and arms) but then it seemed like it was just falling  What I saw was the screen moving left, right, up, down. In spirals going in one direction or going in opposite direction at the same time sort of like the butterfly effect shape feeling like I was traveling though one of the spirals like a tunnel and one where I'm turning around inside a donut shaped spiral. Seeing the color red becoming bright then returning back to normal. I could feel my eye spasming whenever i closed my eyes. I think around the 7-8 minutes I started seeing the screen move popping up in different places. I was then becoming a bit nauseous. What looked like a face, then a person taking up the majority of the screen. They looked female  What looked like a long spine twisting back and forth; translucent, connected tubes twirling around the screen (like spider legs, almost); swirling lights, like a sci-fi rendition of entering a wormhole; alternating black, red, and blue colors; black ""teeth"" at the top and bottom, slowly closing in on the center, then morphing into almost a star or sun (or artistic rendering of). What looked like specks of dust on the screen, uninked comic panels, a movie theater with lights splashed on the screen, black shapes moving and interacting, geometric patterns. I dozed off for a couple moments and these were most vivid at this time. When I first started the video, I saw what looked like a giant X going through the entirety of the screen, intersecting at where my eyes were looking. The X slowly morphed into multiple X's, all intersecting at the center of my vision. After a minute or two, I began seeing triangle/pyramid shapes. The pyramid shapes then formed into a landscape, with the pyramid being half-submerged into the ground on the right. I also saw spiderweb like designs that spanned the entirety of the screen. At one point, a silhouette of the female lower body was visible, with a 3D like view of it that was rotating on the Z-axis. I also saw a long road with walls on either side, with the feeling of fast motion ""driving"" down the road. There was also a corridor-like massive room with similar visuals to the previous road experience, with different size block like protrusions coming out of either side of the walls, while feeling as if I was moving forward towards a type of ""opening"" at the end that never came to pass. When I first started there was nothing, just black and red changing colors. Then the colors started to mix with each other, while the four corners of the screen were always black, the middle of the screen was always red. While I was sitting back and watching calmly, eyes appeared on the screen, eyes, nose, mouth, then a person looked towards me from the screen and smiled. I got a little closer to the screen and then the silhouette disappeared and I found myself in a roller coaster, on a roller coaster. I could watch the amusement park from the top while I was speeding. Fairgrounds, lights, etc. each could be distinguished, albeit a little blurry. When I started the test, I first had tingling in the sides of my brain. At 20 seconds, my upper eyelids went down. My whole brain started to tingle. I saw simple shapes in different colors. Then those shapes started to become a corridor. I started seeing a subway station at night. After 2 minutes, I felt uncomfortable and left the test. when my eyes were open (most of the time) i saw swirling,various colours like blue,green ,changing patterns moving in different directions.when i closed my eyes the vision was black with hundreds od very thin green wavy lines,first creating a tunnel effect,then it was as if i was swimming through an underwater garden of coral Whirlpools, tunnel of clouds, crystal lattices, sinkhole whit round shape with arms (clock like), little color sheers white and blue colour White balls of light, white diagonal streaking lights, blue circle covering the screen White bouncing light at times creating a triangle or pyramid shape. White circles all around the screen white clouds, blue waves, red balls white colour White dot white dots about 5 of them White geometric patterns scaling up and down, fading in and out, panning around the screen. Sometimes it was a tessellation of circles and diamonds. Also entered a spinning spiral White lights in the middle of the screen, across horizontally. The whole screen, besides red was showing yellow and blue. At the top and the bottom there were black separate lines pointing to the center but vanished before touching the white light, which was sometimes star-shaped (4 points) White roses getting bigger and smaller whitish bluish rotating triangles in the center of screen, red black and blue flickering,  Wiggling worms wildly bumping point, tunnel like patterns, round moving patterns, a ""mountain"" turning into a triangle before disappearing, other simple flat images Winged person then a person waving  wings With the white noise, I remember seeing geometric patterns, psychedelic patterns, Charlie Brown-like children holding hands in a circle (2D), then bombs exploding, a rocket, then 2D flowers, trees, then a 3D ""yoga master"" sitting in Lotus position with balls of light around his head; without the white noise, a bee & honeycomb, many people in different positions, performing tasks, a woman's face and hair but could not make out the details of the face. Within first few minutes, started noticing faint outlines of geometric and somewhat shifting shapes (like fractals), a few minutes later started seeing the kind of blossoming flower or opening portal effect and a few minutes after that, started noticing different colors. Also intermittently appeared as though the entire screen was swirling to the right --- kind of like a whirlpool --- more often it appeared to be throbbing Within seconds I began to see geometrical objects, then the field took on dimensionality. Within a minute, I could see things that appeared like planets revolving around each other in space. Within the first 30 seconds or so, when I would blink or close my eyes, my entire FOV was possibly the most gorgeous fractals I've seen in my own head. About that time, off the screen in the dark, that visual field was being taken over by a duller fractal, but not on the screen. After about a minute and some change, with my eyes open, I started seeing the silhouette of a face. I want to also say that I am VERY imaginative, and have music playing in my head 24/7. I am also very capable of creating full scenes in my own my mind. Within the first few seconds I saw shapes, geometric patterns, interconnecting circles. Especially star patterns appeared again and again. After approximately 30 seconds, I saw the screen flashing in different colors. The patterns continued. After a few minutes shapes began to move - like a rising and setting sun; a bird flying in the distance. The whole screen started to swirl. Moving but somewhat unclear shapes continued to appear. At almost 10 minutes a picture emerged. Thunderstorm clouds forming, growing expanding - covering the starry night sky. This image persisted the next minutes, growing clearer and then again dimmer. Until in the end I saw a big meadow, surrounded by soft rolling hills. The sky covered in huge thunderstorms. The edges of the clouds seemed bright, as if a extremely bright moon was hiding behind the thunderstorm. The picture was only lightly colored though, not as vivid. Witnessed more colors (blue, grey, green, purple). Screen rotated 45 degrees sometimes, ghosting a diamond in front of a rectangle monitor. Saw the Eye of Sauron a lot, & some instances of vague face-shapes (like through a heavily-frosted window, or pressed against a white sheet). Saw simple environments while speeding into them. Tunnels (smooth/rocky both) & scifi wormholes--these paths curved randomly. Also roads & hiking trails with landscape/fields/forest/trees around--these paths were straight. Landscape indistinct, like objects too close to road of a traveling car. wobbling double helix, something like a galaxy turning around all the time, something like a worm moving with it's whole body wolves fighting, batman symbol flashing, spinning galaxy, a crucifix, a cart traveling down a mineshaft Woman with long hair  Words flying past, like pages in a book being flipped or words on a teleprompter wormhole/space travel tunnels. running through a pine forest then travelling upwards through nearly infinitely tall trees before the image resolved into water surface with the rippling trails of water-walking insects. X patterns appearing, checker board pattern, spiral loop moving around, white/black snakes going around and up the screen, a completely black person with a white glow kneeling in the middle of the screen X shape in the center of the screen extending outward to the edges, eye like concentric, yellow circles morphing and expanding, panes folding over one another. Yellow, green, and blue dispersed between shapes Yellow , lighting, a zig zag orange black sign, yellow bright explosions, the beginning of the face of a clown.  Yellow blue sometimes maroon, dark branching spots, vague drawing outline of a face Yellow flickering points of light Yellow green lights,  abstract  Yellow or faint rainbow diagonal lines that floated from the corners to the middle and disappeared  Yellow orange and sparkling blue green flickering lights.
The sparkling bluegreen looked like a sea at times, other times it was a jagged divide vertically across the center of the screen (a sparkling river and bay) between darkness on the left and a walled city/castle on the right.
 yellow orbs or streaks of light that were purple on the edges that I would chase around the screen with my line of sight. Briefly I saw numerous white lights as the background stayed dark; the light at one point formed the outline or more rigid shapes or structures Yellows and Greens at the peripheral edges. Morphing psychedelic-style geometric patterns. Leaf shapes that swayed back and forth. Vortex style imagery rotating like you see in the sea sometimes or water when it goes down a plug-hole / drain. I also saw tunnels that spin like in Doctor Who (time travel tunnels) with vibrant colours on the edges like yellow, blue and green. With the white noise enabled I also had some minor auditory effects like inaudible whispers and shrill cries.  You know how when they record music they have those control s with the lights that show all the different variable of sound levels etc. that go up and down with the music. I saw that the whole time at the bottom and it lined up with the white noise. I also saw different shapes, and i mages in the middle and the est of the periphery was like the optical 3d illusion of a long extended  hall way. Sometimes the screen flashed yellow or orange for long periods of time. Zebra oval ball spots Zooming into a grid of shapes, faces twisted into a cruel smile flickering near the edges, possibly some trees, but mainly red, green, and black."

The white noise and screen together gave me an uneasy feeling, but nothing noteworthy, just a ""If this was a horror movie this would be the part where someone dies"" feeling. Nothing serious, just subtle in the back of my mind, I was fine to continue viewing - I think it was more the white noise static than anything -.
After a while (around 5m) I realized that if I stared at a point, It would seem like everything was flickering from that point. It was around this time that the blue hues started appearing as well. They did not interfere with the red, it was more like I was seeing ""in-between"" the red flashes, just the screen would for a fraction of a second appear blue between flashes of red. 
Occasionally the focus point would have somewhat different shades of red (generally lighter, as if an outdent or maybe indented from the rest?), and this would continue slightly in short maybe inch long lines sun-raying out from the point. However these lines would pretty much disappear when I blinked. 
At one point after staring for maybe 3 minutes the pace of flickering increased and it got a  yellowish hue, flashing red to yellow to grey-blue, but this effect did not last for more than 2 or 3 seconds before it went back to just red and grey/blue. I was unable to repeat the effect. However, whenever I looked at a point for long enough, it did feel like the rate of flickering increased.

I never had anything other than a red flicker on a Thinkpad in a dark bedroom with scary static though.","5-7 minutes, For the first five or so minutes nothing happened. After that if I focused on any given point for more than a minute it would start to seem to flicker ""from"" that point (eminating outward). Moreover, I saw ""lines"" of what looked like indendation in the red (different hue) coming from that point. Also whenver I was focusing on the screen I would begin to see hues of blue inbetween the red, and at one point it appeared yellow.","If I focused on a point for more than a minute I would get it to flicker from there. I had maybe 3 times total where the ""lines"" appeared. The blue hues were constant after around the 5 minute mark -- In the flashes where red was not visible the screen would be a dark grey blue color. The yellow was only once after maybe 3 minutes of constant focus.","No images, only the screen appearing to be blue.",As long as I focused on the screen I could keep the blue hues constant. The yellow hue vanished when I blinked. The lines would remain for a few seconds before essentially being the same as the rest.,"Became relaxed or sleepy, Slight to Moderate sense of dread.","When I would stare at a point on screen for a while my focus would sort of fade, like what usually happens when you try to focus on the same thing for a while - your mind wants to wander - Those moments of losing focus were somewhat relaxing, but I remained mostly alert.

It was like watching a trippy video of colours and sounds.

Audibly: I heard a sort of monophonic ringtone sound that was increasing notes...chromatically if I’m not mistaken...no actual tune to it. At one point it did seem to be random notes, not in any order but not what I would describe as tuneful. 

Visually: I saw, initially, lines jutting out from the centre of my vision forming a star, a cross, an X and then I was able to sort of ride the lines with my perspective...like falling through a tunnel or riding a rollercoaster. I then saw large balls floating around on the outside of my vision and I was eventually able to look at them and follow their random paths. I then saw streaks of rainbow or spectrum travel fairly steadily across my vision. 

I was able to relax my vision from time to time to try and see more but the random assortment of simple and semi complex shapes would have me unknowingly sort of ‘focus’...as in near vision or far vision...if that makes sense. At one point I saw red and black checkerboard which would increase in size or decrease depending on how close/far I focused my vision.

I really want to “cure” my Aphantasia...

I tried viewing the flicker on an Oculus Go VR headset, but the flicker was temperamental and not steady on it’s built in browser. I ended up using an iPad Pro 12 inch with headphones on and held it as close to my face as I could.

I will be repeating this as well as the Ganzfeld videos I’ve seen that are constant red with white noise.

I was hoping for hallucinatory images of magnificent beauty, but no such events happened.

With other musics: At first only random lines. Sometimes like moving watercolors with reds and blues, lots of purples and pinks, yellows in the bottom. Once a pink tunnel.

But most of the time the annoyying pulsating light.

NOTE: I have a hyperactive mind and an internal TV going at very fast pace all the time, images morphing into other images. I am on ADHD meds, gradually the imaginery slowed and became more simplistic all the way to seeing black. I also have trouble imagining visually on demand, but have vivid dreams and in a way I know in my head what things look like. 

I actually turned around and closed my eyes to see if I could have images again and had some very slow moving, like a purple aquatic plant floating over an ugly curtain-like fabric.

Before ADHD diagnosis I found out psychedelics actually slow down my inner eye.

3975,Male,27,2,10min.,Yes,Computer,"Somewhat enjoyable, but easy to stop","Simple shapes or patterns (e.g., ball of light, lines, grids, spiderwebs, geometric shapes)","The most common type of imagery that I saw were similar to the horizontal or vertical swipe effect that we can see on old television. For example, if I saw horizontal lines there were multiple of them and they seemed to go from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen. Sometimes both horizontal and vertical lines would be seen at the same time making some kind of grid. The lines were always black. The effect is similar to this: https://youtu.be/3BJU2drrtCM?t=77, but more pronounced like the 1600fps clip in that video. So I could make out the individual lines and they were at an angle.

It happened that sometimes it seemed like I was seeing a pattern like if you were looking at the front of a lit flashlight like this one: https://www.dreamstime.com/stock-photography-led-flash-light-image9174022. The best way to describe it would be red circles in place of where the flashlight LEDs would be and and the black around it is similar to the moving at light-speed effect.

The third pattern I could sometimes see would be similar to the backlight bleeding effect that some monitor can have. You can imagine something like this: https://s2.qwant.com/thumbr/0x380/7/3/0c38d59954880e31d99e12b43f748a4bf344148e6ec20558eae3c6c3f8eee1/backlight.jpg?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tabbloidx.co%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F08%2Fbacklight.jpg&q=0&b=1&p=0&a=0 but more grid like. So a grid that at the edges has a similar effect at the backlight effect and inside the grid the cells were not very regular.

All those patterns would come and go depending on where I looked on the screen and how open my eyes were. They also felt cyclic, but I am not sure.

The geometries swung around with great energy the entire field of the color swinging inward and outward and all around like double doors not bound to natural laws. The geometry then began to form into people. They were all tainted with red but their structures were well defined. I remember a skull spinning around haphazardly with great structural detail. All the structures were geometrically idealized lacking in texture and in formal color other than that of a sort of middle hue of washed out red. It was in this state of figures that I closed my eyes for a few moments to recover somewhat and saw an intensely vivid geometric strata like that of Islamic tile work in stunning saphire and baby blues with black lines emphasizing the structure and the color of the geometry radiating outward from a central point. When I looked at the screen again I recognized the geometry of the wheel spoke pattern but washed out and with no color. I then looked away from the screen and the wood of the desk I was centered in was melting into rainbow. In this moment I was quite uncomfortable and decided that it was probably best for me to finish the experience early.

I actually went with Grey noise as that seemed (according to studies on noise) to be a better balance of noise rather than white noise I had a good listen in the dark and was probably in danger of going to sleep so cranked up the Ganzflicker.  It was good almost straight away, felt like a river of energy flowing past you mostly coming towards me out of the screen from one corner and then the other that alternated in swirls and other patterns that were all pretty organic.  I felt I could go deeper and every time I blinked it seemed to start back with the flashing lights and then into some cool stuff then I had to blink again and start all over.
Im not sure why but I thought it was the grey noise so I went out and to the link and did the white noise.  That changed things remarkably which I thought was interesting, the shapes and patterns became much more geometric and im gunna say logical for lack of a better word, but I saw stuff like a double helix and lots of squares with slightly rounded edges (like calculator buttons) in a multitude of rapidly repeating patterns and flows that spun and twisted and reformed it was very very cool and very enjoyable.
Then it changed up and was back to this river type feeling and it felt like I was standing in the edge of it with most of it flowing past me but a bit going behind me as well.  I actually felt a bit anxious that I might get swept away and then I started to see stuff in the river flowing down stream at speed, A guy on a horse Cowboy like the Winchester gun logo  sort of set up and then i saw Buffalo running in a herd.  They appeared as like a black pencil sketch or etching against the red river. 
I also heard dolphins, couldn't see them but sort of felt they were there in the river and knew where they were, you could sort of see the swirling they made underneath the swirling of the river so I could see where they were under the surface but they just didn’t really show themselves. 
Also saw stars, white stars on a black background, that was really weird as mostly everything I had see to that point was on a red background so when the red went away (it sorted faded to the side of my vision) and I saw the black and the stars I thought I may have closed my eyes without realising it, but I blinked and re opened then and it was red again for a second and then the black and the stars showed themselves again.
It felt like I had sort of stuck my head through the rushing red river and out the other side where it was quieter and you could see the sky and the stars.  Remined me of movie 2001 when Dave looks inside the monolith and says its full of stars.
I was doing this lying in bed and by this stage was so relaxed I was struggling to hold the laptop so ended it there.",A few seconds,"Frequently, really only saw the cowboy and the Buffalo as images the rest was shapes and 3d swirls and son on.  but i saw them a few times and they were moving, running legs going or at least the impression of them running","Weak, faint, or insubstantial, Clear and moderately vivid, the images were 3d but set back in the screen, the river and the shapes however were all around me at times","Persisting several seconds, Constant, morphing from one image to the next","Became relaxed or sleepy, Lost a sense of space, I found i had lost any perception of how i was sitting and holding the laptop and i was very relaxed and happy, not really sleepy ","Not a change of consciousness i felt very very close to that when i saw the stars, i very much wanted to push through the red river and see the stars better, i was very happy and at ease.

Vanishing point would follow the center of my vision. After a minute or so I started to see flickers of blue and yellow (are certain sub pixels able to turn off faster on my LCD maybe?). Eventually (maybe 5 minutes in) the image became more hallucinatory and less of an artifact, it started to feel like I was in a form of train or elevator car that was rotating at a very high speed (like the flickering was every time I caught a gimps of daylight perhaps). I told myself to have it spin the opposite direction and was able to visualize that, too, so I don't think it had anything to do with monitor refresh rate. My imagination reminded me of a carousel and I started to visualize being on one in a clean city park with buildings across the road and looking down a T-intersection in my center of vision. Then I started to imagine a train ride again; but instead of it rotating, I was seeing the track bend left and right, alternating, while I ""looked out the front window"". At this point I didn't think my brain would be doing anything fancier/trippier, so I closed my eyes out of curiosity and found the flicker to more absolute in my vision but less intense, so it didn't seem to have the same effect.

Also noticed that my eyes watered and felt warm. The former was likely because I wasn't blinking enough; but the latter I wonder if it was related to bloodflow to my eyes trying to maintain a focus on an item that wasn't there, because I could almost feel some strain as well.","1-2 minutes, 5-7 minutes",Infrequently,"Weak, faint, or insubstantial, Clear, but not vivid","Constant, morphing from one image to the next","No change, fully alert in the here and now",,In the center

During the second, 10 minute session, it began the same way but the bars of light were more vivid and with many colors, and appearing at every angle, and then constantly rotating and crossing over each-other and reforming and dissolving. Around half way through I began to see what seemed like eyes, but then the bars became more intense and overshadowed that effect.

Most interestingly, from around six minutes in until the end, I gained clear conscious control over the angle of the bars: I would ""will"" there to be a bar of a certain slope, or two crossing bars in a particular orientation, and they would appear as such, before dissolving or rotating unpredictably. I spent that whole time testing this ""ability"", and was able to make the bars quickly and easily, but more complex shapes never happened as a result of my volition, besides one circle.","They began to emerge immediately, A few seconds","Frequently, Constantly, straight bars of color at all different angles appeared nearly throughout, some other patterns were more intermittent",Clear and moderately vivid,"Constant, morphing from one image to the next","No change, fully alert in the here and now, Became relaxed or sleepy","Sometimes I was quite sleepy, other times fully alert and interested, occasionally slightly nervous.",All over the screen

Their colors were inverting at roughly the same pace as the flicker. I usually saw red, orange and yellow but occasionally it would turn blue-ish. These shapes remind of a time I had a bad trip on marijuana. 

The screen seemed to expand from the pixels to the bevels of the monitor (~0.5 inches). It took roughly 4 seconds to complete, slowing down near the end. This happened every time I blinked. 

Then I saw grids. The grid was slowly rotating clockwise. Eventually it turned into several circles which rotated the same direction but faster. This is around where the significant color imagery occurred. The whole screen seemed to go through the most of the color wheel aside from the lighter, less vibrant and darker colors (e.g. light blue, purple, but not blue). 

I would cycle through all the above, and I noticed the rotating balls would go faster if I focused on four mid-corners of the screen (not too close to the screen corners). 

I eventually saw an eye for a couple seconds but it was nothing too detailed.","1-2 minutes, 5-7 minutes","Infrequently, Frequently","Weak, faint, or insubstantial","Constant, morphing from one image to the next","Became relaxed or sleepy, As if in a dreamlike state, Felt transported to another place","Earlier I mentioned a bad trip on marijuana.

When I'm sober, it's rare but not unusual for me to think about the concept of afterlife, in the sense that if it was ""enjoyable"" and eternal, would it ever stop being ""enjoyable"" because of the length of exposure. It makes no sense to me to be ""forever in bliss"" because I don't believe you can have bliss without downtime. It would become your new normal. 

This experience was more relaxed. I didn't feel too bothered by the illusions. It never occurred to me that I could be trapped and I would hate this existence if it lasted forever. For a few moments, it was more like ""if this was the only thing on my mind, I would never notice what I was missing out on"".

It reminded me of of when a roll of film starts and isn't quite up to speed so you can still see a quick flash in between each frame.","Initially I began to see two black triangles one growing up from the bottom of the screen and the other descending from the top. They began to round out slightly and connected in the middle of the screen to create the silhouette of an hourglass. As the sand ran into the bottom of the hourglass it began to grow and sharpen. The perimeter of the screen flashed deep blue and the bottom half of the hourglass slowly transformed into huge black pyramid that seemed to glow yellow around the edges. Soon the angle began to change making the pyramid appearing to continue growing. I felt dwarfed in comparison. Eventually the pyramid grew large enough that it covered to whole screen. After that my eyes unfocused for a bit and it was just flashing but a moment or so later these abstract blobs appeared from the edges of the screen and began to float aimlessly combining when they bumped into each other and splitting apparently randomly. The blobs were all different colors but they seemed very desaturated while the background remained a very bright red. It had a similar effect to playing desaturated film or animation to denote a memory, or flashback and I gained the impression that I was looking at a ghost of an image. The blobs began moving to the right side of the screen and combining into one blob and turning a sort of cool gray color which slowly took the shape of a woman (from about mid-thigh to shoulders) facing the left side of the screen. The outline was wobbly and fluid at first as the blobs came together but they soon began to clarify as the movement shifted solely towards her stomach and she grew steadily pregnant. The background became a sort of desaturated greenish grey color and the woman's silhouette darkened considerably (but not to fully black). Everything slowly faded out and my eyes unfocused again. When they refocused I saw bright moving shapes and patterns similar to what I see when I close my eyes very tightly or press on them slightly. The patterns dissipated and made way for a black and white image of the pregnant woman from the mid-thigh up leaning against an ivy covered stone wall and looking out at a city skyline at sunset. Although the image itself was black and white, I got the distinct impression that the woman's hair (which was in a ponytail that ended just above the middle of her shoulders blades) was a light brown. Additionally, although I couldn't see much of her legs or her feet I'm pretty sure she wore leggings and ballet flats. At that point I wondered if I had any control over what I was seeing so I attempted to make the woman walk across the screen from left to right while trailing her hand lightly allow the wall. When this was successful I tried to make her walk back the other direction and found that this made the image ""glitch"" and that reverse her previous movement  as though I was hitting a rewind button or I could extend the landscape around her so that she could continue to walk towards the right but I couldn't make her walk from right to left. Once again, my eyes unfocused and the image disappeared.

Others were less extravagant, such as a generic beach, a campsite in a forest, or an open air pavilion in a public park. These images were brighter than the the previous ones.

From then on, by relaxing, the imagery was about as in depth as the after-image from a too-bright room, occasionally ""popping-out"" of the screen in the way the ""magic eye"" books work.  most of the imagery was focused around the center of my vision, things like balls and blobs, but later on morphed into a larger and larger revolving sphere of honeycomb, slowly increasing in size until the edge of the sphere became the horizon of a planet, in a sci-fi way, but again, no greater clarity than a combination after-image/magic eye.

I would try this out at an earlier time but between how long this description already is and how getting a similarly-lengthed session at such a time in my current situation may be difficult due to noise, this will have to do. Sorry.

DESCRIPTION:

Throughout a lot of what I saw the simple red/black imagery acted like a veil of varying transparency

The first images I saw were pretty vivid. The very first of these I saw was a carousel of faces from a top-down perspective. They soon dispersed and I began seeing in black and white, with the first thing I witnessed being what looked like simple drawings floating upwards before a transition to furniture - like desks and tables - doing the same thing.

Note that for the majority of what I witnessed, it would continue to have this sort of monochrome black/white perspective. It was grainy like an old film or certain imaging technology like night vision, but in a way that you can probably see in some artistic styles, where the black and white were used to either indicate light or to highlight certain parts of a shape/figure/etc, etc.

After this I had a perspective of someone standing at one end of a rope bridge and I watched a black figure running across it, getting smaller as they gained distance from my point of view towards the base of a massive cylindrical object made of concrete(?).

Afterwards, I had a person sending forth some kind of beam of light that pierced the clouds above them, which then transitions to the next description.
I'd then get spotlights on various things for a while, but there was never enough white on the objects despite the light to make any of it out. Soon I had a perspective of the source of the spotlight though and it was just being emitted out of thin air. A person fell a great distance yet was not harmed nor bothered because they immediately began to run. Unfortunately for them though there was some kind of fleshy (the pink and the yellowy-white included here), sinewy monster that took to housing itself in this weird book/chest with sharp teeth (e.g canines from a carnivore) sticking out of it, much like a hermit crab. It was either bipedal (but with its spidery legs resting like a crab's, instead of it standing tall) or ""tripedal"" .Its legs were long and seemed impossibly thin (kind of like a spider's) for what it likely weighed, yet it lurched itself forward pretty fast and gave chase to the fallen person as they turned away and entered a full sprint. The creature was about to catch up but the person had just gone through a detached doorway leading somewhere else. Instead of giving up though, it fired a continuous laser through the open doorway and with that my first lot of complex images ended. 

I can't really remember a lot past this, though I did once have a perspective of flying through a void and zooming past what could've been a beautiful, stout vase-like piece of pottery. It was white and blue like fine china, except I saw the upper section of it to have maybe had enamel painted on it in tiny diamond shapes to give it texture, rather than being smooth.

Doing it for extended periods of time seemed to reduce the frequency and how often images would be notably vivid for me. This may just coincide with me growing increasingly tired, however.

 Trying out music would take away my focus from more complex imagery. During this time though I did repeatedly, very vividly and clearly envision a simplified big-round-headed humanoid figure that glowed with white and was riddled with moving horizontal, rectangular black shapes. It did a few things but I don't really remember what. I think I once saw it pluck a flower and try to give it to some obscured entity. Any attempts for me to focus it into a more accurate human shape would only last for a second at most before the images would momentarily stop, before returning to the figure doing something. Sometimes when attempting this manipulation it would just stretch out in one direction infinitely. Not disturbingly, but more in that odd, sometimes goofy way when something goes wrong with a digital 3D model.

None of the simple images inbetween the many scenes were really remarkable and remained as black/red only, but my mind would frequently show a lot of spinning patterns and also frequently turned them into 3D objects to rotate clockwise whilst it would continue spinning and it seemed to do this with a surprising amount of accuracy and consistency. Obviously this is subjective and other simultaneous patterns could've obfuscated anything weird but I still believe it to be noteworthy.

EXTRA OBSERVATIONS:

Observing the Ganzflicker with one eye would show intense perceptions of simple imagery with occasional transitions to something more complex. Either eye saw something significantly different, one sometimes more clear than the other. There would be changes in the geometry like how 'dense' the patterns were packed into the same area as the other, how blurry it was, what shapes made up the same pattern. Stuff like that. However the imagery was marginally less clear overall and would only stay as red/black. One time this led to me being within some kind of ring with a groove on the inside and the perspective was just of something continuously going along said groove at a high speed. 
After this when using both eyes I would envision a lot more tunnels, including a rail tunnel at one point that led to a bridge with a view of a ruined cityscape. A rotating perspective around a train that materialised out of nowhere gave me a decent view and buildings were crumbled and on fire (one part of the city was just a pile of large granules). This was also the only definite complex landscape I would witness, however it was not very clear.

Closing my eyes during the Ganzflicker also would produce new patterns. I don't really have the words to describe them but during one attempt they swirled like they were fine grains in a fluid I disturbed and from then on in that attempt I had a constant 'vision effect' of being underwater or looking at water being swirled or otherwise disturbed.

Coming back after writing all of the above and doing a quick observation was interesting too. I saw four sets of whatever you call those sets of wheels you get in a combination lock, in some kind of intricate device. Each were of identical length, probably 16 wheels long each. Some were scrolling rapidly, most being in the middle but a few towards the ends away from the centre of the screen also scrolled. They had numbers but also alphabetical characters on them. Returning my attention to the centre gave way to a growing white background with gibberish printed in text across it. The background consisted of straight lines and resembled an upside down T-shape.",A few seconds,"simple shapes constant (like a veil), complex shapes came fairly frequently","Clear, but not vivid, Clear and moderately vivid, Clear, vivid, and/or bright",Anything complex that came would last a minute or two at best and would morph. Simple images were always present and also morphing. ,Varying states from the above.,"My sense of time would constantly vary but was generally quite slow.

Otherwise I would transition from the relaxed and sleepy state to the dreamlike unless if I brought myself to attention. I would then be in a relatively normal state of mind until I allowed myself to lose focus again.

During the former though it was a lot like doing those relaxation exercises where you progress from moving the muscles in your feet and no longer using them, then your lower leg muscles, etc. My focus would vary and the dreamlike state for me was near identical to that of when you daydream and you get lost in your head. A few times I found myself slack-jawed too. I could bring myself to being fully alert during either of these states.",All over the screen

After a while it was hard to focus, at which point it looked like the flicker became red, blue, purple and white, and I was no longer seeing any clear shapes. Toward the end, bright, curving white lines appeared on screen, moving in long arcs like sedate worms, and shortly thereafter, geometric shapes which had a fractal quality and seemed to shrink towards infinity at the center of my vision; these shapes alternated between circles (which was the most prominent), triangles, and squares (the least prominent). The longer I watched, the more complex the visuals became, although throughout the experience, there were brief flashes of more sophisticated hallucinations, particularly eyes, teeth, and wounds like gashes. These became more frequent as I went on. Often times these more complex hallucinations were mixed in strange ways, as though collaged in a sort of cubistic style: sometimes literally, as though viewed through a prism; and sometimes metaphorically, as though a broken bit of white, sharp teeth occupied a part of the screen while a wide open eye stared at me from another.

As I watched the flicker and listened to the static, it felt almost as though I was straining to see a threatening shape at night, and listen for its movements, but there was so much noise (as opposed to signal) that I couldn't make it out, and that if I didn't manage to I was in danger. I noticed afterwards that I was sweating slightly, and that my eyes were dry from holding them open too wide and too long. 

also, it's hard to explain, but at times I felt like the flickering on the screen was growing out of my computer and not just enveloping my vision, but becoming my vision, with no clear boundary between what I was seeing and what I was looking at. This was strongly coupled with losing my sense of time, and when the static stopped playing I was quite surprised that ten minutes had already gone by.

Incidentally, it is very odd to me to imagine anything approximating a dreamlike or sleepy reaction to the experience. I feel like I need to do something cathartic and relaxing to shake the lingering malaise that thing gave me.","In the center, All over the screen"
2104,Male,50,6,10min.,Yes,Computer,"Enjoyable, didn't want it to stop","Simple shapes or patterns (e.g., ball of light, lines, grids, spiderwebs, geometric shapes), Colors other than red and black, Complex environments (e.g., cityscapes, forests), symmetrical reflections, e.g. the opening of ""Dark"" on Netflix https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c399HPb01s","Immediately I saw rectangular/square/reticular tilings/tessellations with mostly red ""tiles"" and dark ""grout."" I was immediately reminded of the visual effects of gently pressing the heels of my palms against my closed eyelids (which I often do to relax or to reduce headache pain). There was a constant sense of motion, varying from a slow walk to a quick pan (e.g. a flock of birds such as pigeons crossing my field of view at fairly close range). Sometimes the shapes were uneven although still aligned (various non-square rectangles packed together almost seamlessly), but other times the edges were more curved, as if viewing through a net of string not tightly stretched.  The ""tiles"" were mostly red, although many seemed to have yellow highlights (as if they were actual red tiles, with their typically slightly curved edges, viewed in early morning or late afternoon sunlight). When the tiles were largest (and, so, seeming closest to my viewpoint) the white noise sounded a bit like the sharp echoes of a tiled room such as a large bathroom or Roman style atrium. After a minute or two (I quickly lost track of time), I saw what appeared to be reflections. These were very similar to looking at a twilight, evening sky reflected in a pond or river, with gloaming, rippling clouds in the center surrounded dark, organic shadows, such as those of twigs or weeds growing on a bank and overhanging the water's surface. These more photographic images were many, but fleeting, always emerging from the tessellations and then dissolving back into them again. I was reminded of the darker and more rhomboidal MC Escher drawings. Many of these scenes also seemed to be vertically reflected, as if in a vertical mirror (e.g. the intro to ""Dark"" on Netflix: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c399HPb01s). Sometimes these implied columns or tree trunks with complex color patterns, but mostly they were symmetrically ""scrolling"" at a common rate but in opposite directions, as if walking slowly while holding a mirror at an oblique angle, causing the right half of the visual field to be a mirror image of the left half. Whenever I blinked, I could see many more colors, including sky blue (occasionally orange or other colored) tiles with green or yellow borders. The tiles near the center of my view were smaller and more detailed, and this effect followed my focus immediately if I moved my center of attention closer to the corners or edges of the monitor. The perceived tilings which were almost entirely rectilinear during the first minutes, became almost entirely hexagonal after roughly 5 minutes. The ""forest reflected in a pond"" effect was the most common non-geometrical image I saw, and was repeated many dozens of times. I also perceived a ""forest sky"" image (essentially the same, but as if looking directly into a sky encircled with trees, rather than a sky reflected in a slightly rippling surface). The white noise mostly disappeared from my perception, but occasionally seemed to sound like a light breeze, twigs underfoot, et al. quiet, ambient forest sounds. Toward the end of the viewing I saw moving spirals very much like waves curling into themselves when crashing against a beach. The white noise increased this impression, and seemed to crest and fall along with the waves. By far the most common perception overall was of tiles moving by (as if walking past a tiled wall) but also quickly transforming from square to various rectangles, occasionally to netting, and eventually into complex arrangements of hexagons; however, the images, most commonly the ""forest in a pond"" and the ""vertically reflected walk"" arose and dissolved every few seconds throughout the viewing, and the ""slowly crashing waves"" eventually appeared as well.","They began to emerge immediately, rectangular tilings immediately, hexagonal tessalations after 5 mins","Constantly, geometric images almost constantly, others (forest, water, etc.) more rarely","crepuscular, as if viewed at twilight, but reddish instead of bluish","Constant, morphing from one image to the next","As if in a dreamlike state, Felt transported to another place, Lost a sense of time, Lost a sense of space, most of the experience seemed slightly ""encased"" (although not claustrophobic).

I don't recall ever noticing a horizon nor any object at apparently great distance. ","I felt mostly curious and interested, as if on a pleasant hike or evening stroll. The quick changes between perceiving geometric patterns (mostly interpreted as tiles, glazed-bricks, et al. antiseptic, indoor environments) and trees or pond-like reflections (almost entirely interpreted as exterior, natural environments) was disorienting, but not unpleasant. I felt in almost constant, but slow paced motion, very much as if walking past scenery, occasionally panning (sweeping my view from side to side), and occasionally stopping to gaze more fixedly and quietly at a given, pleasant scene (e.g. a sky reflected in a pond, or a wave crashing on a beach).

I remember thinking, ""oh, crystalline prisms"". This was one of the colors I most vividly remember, the prism was gleaming. Then it morphed into a big X with like a vertical and horizontal line through the X, which then became like a butterfly (but not a vivid butterfly, like a sketch of hard lines and angles, if thats even possible?

Then in the blink of an eye I saw two sumo wrestlers giving their one foot, two foot, ready, set, go!  They smashed into each other over and over until finally one overcame the other.  The two of them began tumbling out of control down a slope and hit a guard rail or something because they stopped with a squish and jiggle.

A moment later it took off flying and I could tell it was a dragon.  The dragon kept flying faster and faster, starting to do barrel rolls close to me so that the strobing was actually the wings rolling past me with great speed.  The dragon disappeared and instantly reappeared flying loops around me with the same veracity.  It felt like something was about to happen, I felt like it was circling tighter and tighter.

I pressed f11 to go to full screen. This reminds me very much of the old Shakti-Tech web site flasher software.  I lightly closed my eyes and directed a neutral gaze toward the screen.  I wish I had an old CRT monitor for this, as they work MUCH better than modern LCD monitors.  Then the images began.  There were swirling diamond shapes of red and black, and I started to see yellow or white intersections where the diamonds were merging and dancing in the center of the screen.  The image shifted and became to me like a lady, walking.  I was seeing her pleated white skirt sway back and forth.  There was bright sunlight shining on us.  She's turning and smiling at me, I see her face for a moment.  Then back to the pleats swaying in the dazzling sunlight, making a fan-like pattern.  This shifted again to be more like geometric shapes.  I opened my eyes at this point to check the time.  I had been using the Ganzflicker for about 1-2 minutes at this moment.  I closed my eyes again and resumed.  There were many such swirling patterns, characters, interactions, and suggestions of scenery or terrain but without full-on environments.  I rememeber much more than what I have described here.  It seemed easy to direct the flow, using techniques for lucid dreaming.

But I decided to make the most of what I have got, so I lightly closed my eyes and leaned back a little in my chair.  I intentionally relaxed and turned off the usual flow of words in my mind.  Entering a meditative state and breathing deeply, I began to see hallucinatory patterns right away.  They shifted to a pattern, a character, a scene, and back to flickering light.  I thought, ""this is fun! I wonder how long I have been using it?"" So I opened my eyes to check the time.  Looked like about 2 minutes.  Easy to shift out of the Ganzflicker hallucinations and back to full waking consciousness.  How long until I need to get ready for work?  Time noted, I went back into the Ganzflicker.  Felt relaxed but mentally aroused by the experience.  Overall it was nice, but I was eventually longing for greater user-control.  I would enjoy very much the ability to adjust the speed and color of the flashing.  Best if these adjustments are in very fine increments, and the hotkeys for this are live during the experience.  I believe this would allow the user to fine-tune the Ganzflicker for maximum effect.  I'd suggest using directional arrows (up = faster, left = color shift toward red) - that way the user can rest one hand on these familiar arrows and steer the experience without much mental overhead. Thanks for sharing your research with me.  Have a nice day.","In the center, In the periphery, All over the screen, At first only in the middle."

Sometimes they would meet as if forming the corner of a room and ceiling, giving a slight sense of depth and location. There were occasional flickers of something that would, inexplicably, make me think of a specific place or object, despite not being visually distinct enough to really ""see"" it--such as a dark mossy forest, or the outside of an old building in a city with the sky behind it. There were a couple moments of seeing a bright ""horizon line"", which reminded me of part of the old iTunes visualizer, and felt a bit like gazing down a digitally rendered room that stretched on infinitely. There was a part where I saw a sort of mobius loop of what seemed like dragon scales, rotating in front of me, where it was tipped up at a slight angle and I could see the front half moving one direction, and the back half moving the opposite way, partly obscured. The colors of the flashing light would also tend to change, sometimes showing vivid red and black splotches that were large and distinct, other times feeling more cyan/blue, or smaller patches of color, and there was even a moment where I saw a distinction between a more orange-red and a more magenta-red. Even the rate of flickering seemed to shift, sometimes seeming very rapid, and other times slowing down. The longest lasting visual I saw was this sort of v-shaped patch that would ""breathe"", shrinking in and then puffing back out in a consistent rhythmic fashion. I was almost able to form it into a ball sort of shape, but only for a moment. (This last one happened at the 10 minute mark, and I wasn't able to go back to it after looking away to restart the white noise.) None of these effects felt terribly vivid to me, but were present enough that I could put language to them. My mind's eye visuals are usually fairly strong (and in fact overlaid themselves atop the flashing once or twice, as I felt my attention span waning) but also not ""strictly visual"", if that makes sense (factoring in motion, facial and bodily expression, proprioception, and other senses). The effects of the flashing also seemed less distinct than my experiences with the sort of ""rainbow confetti"" CEVs I experience from taking psilocybin mushrooms (which are also distinct from my mind's eye visuals).","A few seconds, They would come and go.","Infrequently, Frequently","Weak, faint, or insubstantial, Clear, but not vivid, Some movement and color was vivid, but it didn't coalesce into anything as vivid as my typical mind's eye visuals.","1-2 seconds, Persisting several seconds, Constant, morphing from one image to the next","No change, fully alert in the here and now, I felt curious and engaged at some points, a bit bored at others.","I didn't feel anything strong enough to consider it a change in my state of consciousness, but the idea of the experiment was interesting and engaging for the most part, and I might like to try it again to see if I can get more out of it.

No matter what was coming up, sooner or later, a vortex (sometimes more than one) would start, somewhere usually to the upper half of my field of view. Sometimes they would be small (the beginning of the experience I saw smaller ones, but they were larger the longer I viewed), but towards the end they would span the whole of the screen. One time it was like rushing down a curving tunnel.

I saw geometric shapes early on - fairly regular diamond shapes (well, like squares turned corner-up). They appeared to be yellow. The earliest shape that wasn't a vortex or a square diamond was a fanged mouth (I know!), or possibly the eyes. I had one go and saw very little then started again with the screen expanded and sitting back, that was more vivid immediately. The fanged mouths moved and seemed to bite, or sometimes shout and scream. The eyes were close together - the faces they were in were quite distant. They weren't friendly either - sometimes developing into slightly clichéd demonic figures with outspread arms. A few times the fanged mouths turned out to belong to roaring bears.

After a while I started getting glimpses of a forest, and I *really* wanted to see that forest. I would feel really frustrated every time it faded, like I hadn't ""accessed"" the right level yet? Something like that. Sometimes the yellowish lines would develop into something like a pyramid, one time with an eye in it! The forest would reoccur, though, and more like viewing the tops of the trees against a sunset/ twilight sky.

The straight lines were yellow, outlined in red, and the mouths were whiteish, the vortices and eyes light purplish.

Because I'm synaesthetic, there was also a texture component, though I'm unsure whether that was from the white noise or the visual elements. Oh, and the white noise started developing coherent elements as well - sometimes snatches of music, other times like wailing voices. There was a definite Souls In Purgatory theme developing!

The imagery was quite compelling, but I felt like I knew where I was most of the time. Sometimes I'd literally pinch myself, or close my eyes for longer than a normal blink (though part of this was because my eyes were starting to dry out) to deliberately dispel the imagery (though part of me was irritated by ""having to start again""). All of it looked/ felt like it was behind a barrier, though the light did start spreading out beyond the screen quite quickly.

The longer I started without moving or blinking my eyes, the more vividly the images came.

The screen soon seemed to be divided into square tiles, usually with an orange and blue checkered pattern, although sometimes it was more complex with dark green tiles of a different shape at the corners of the other tiles. The dark green tiles were covered in a pattern of irregular, little, curly scratches. The flickers came to more or less fill my visual field. Sometimes, I'd start to see little spinning wheels around the periphery, showing through the checkered pattern, also decorated with these irregular, little, curly scratches.

Bright orange and dark blue/purple predominated. An especially bright orange/yellow glow appeared in the center of the screen. It sometimes became the center of an asterisk, with bright lines extending to the edges of my visual field. The bright lines consisted of parallel stripes of different colors, like rainbows. At one point, I saw a collection of such rainbow lines extending across my visual field from a point low down and central. Sometimes thick, bright lines would appear at various angles and offsets from the center. These lines had bright and dark bands alternating along their length. Sometimes the bright and dark bands would seem to be moving along the lines. If I concentrated, I could change the direction of movement.

Like the shape was still itself, but the sides would go into itself while maintaining its shape. Im not sure if that made sense.","At first, i saw lines on the edges if the screen. These lines would slowly grow, encompassing the sides of the screen, with only one line going towards the center. From there, i saw an X mark on the screen as, then the colors started to look slightly different, and the flickering was no longer constant. The X was dark, i woild say black, but to me it just felt like a shadow-ish form of black. Very clear, but not exactly as popping out as the lines were. (The lines were red and white, if that makes sense- extremely clear and vivid). While the X was there, the flickering would be irregular- Sometimes it would pause on red for slightly longer, other times on black. There would also be discoloration on the red, where it would be brighter- something closer to pink. There would also be times, but very briefly, where the color would just disappear and it would look like a gray-black-bluish color. Im not sure if that makes sense, but it was like it was devoid of color. Then, it shifted to the shapes. At first, i would see simple rectangles, squares or diamonds. A bit later and they started rotating at extremely high speeds. Then it got to the point where the rotations themselves started to look weird. They would rotate in 2 different directions at the same time, of they would rotate unto itself. From there, i got the top view of a sort of underwater waterfall(?). The water would fall into a giant hole in the center, and the hole was extremely dark in contrast to the top of the waterfall. Then ut changed into a face. The face was very weird. At first it looked like some sort of kaleidoscope with facial features, but then it started going dark and expanding to the sides- turning into an oval. Then, it changed into a forest, but the forest didn't pop out as much as the waterfall (the waterfall felt as if i was looking at it in real life, but the forest looked artificial(?)). From there, the trees turned into towers, with weird shaped windows that looked like it was a mesh between rectangles bent in half and circles. The towers themselves werent as clear as the windows for some reason.then i blinked( i was blinking regularly during this) and the screen looked infinitely darker. The original bright red was very dark, as if it were the color of wine. Thats where i stopped because my eyes started to get sore, and i had a slight headache.The noise(i clicked the link about 5 seconds before the flickering video) stopped at 8:43.","A few seconds, It took about half a minute for images to show up, but they were slightly indescribable. The closest thing would probably be some sort of lines starting to carve on the screen. These lines would look like... im not sure if it is possible for whoever is reading this to search for, but if you go online and look up images of an egg, with a bird inside, on a flashlight. And you see like those lines on the egg? Thats what i started to see. Then it took about 40ish seconds for it to change patterns or for other images to show up.","Frequently, Constantly, There were many different images, some vague and some extremely vivid. It would alternate on what felt like 40 seconds, but it was probably mostly irregular. I saw some sort of face sometimes, others would be shapes or rotating shapes. Other times would be landscapes like waterfalls or rainforests (i assume happened because the white noice started to sound like water to me at some point). I also started to see shapes in the form of buildings with oddly shaped windows, but it was more vague than the ither images.","Clear, but not vivid, Clear, vivid, and/or bright, Very vivid, almost real, or popping out of the screen, A majority of what i saw was vivid with the exception of the building. The building was clear to me, but not vivid. It wasn't as present(?) to me as the other images.","Persisting several seconds, Constant, morphing from one image to the next, I said before that it felt what could be around 40 seconds for it to change, but i saw over a dozen images so it was probably irregular","As if in a dreamlike state, Felt transported to another place, Lost a sense of time, Lost a sense of space, I still felt the clothes on me and heard background noises for while, but they started to get blocked out until i forgot them. My sense of time was completely gone after a minute or two, i felt like it went on for well over 10min. Then, with the waterfall image, i forgot i was where i was and felt as if i was levitated above the underwater waterfall.","At first, I was normal. The white noice was meh, and i didnt really care- i started getting bored. Then I started to experience change in what i was seeing, so i got slightly curious, but felt if i tried to look at it directly, it might dissappear. So i didnt focus on the slight changes. Then, as the noise kept going, the images kept changing, and i started to find it harder and harder to stay concentrated. It was around then that i started to lose my sense of time. Have you ever felt like a second was longer than 5, or a minute shorter than 30seconds? Thats how i felt. Then it got to the waterfall image, and i fully lost myself of that one. It was as if i didnt have any other thought on my mind, except for the sight of that waterfall. And when i heard the drops of water, the sound of the impact felt several seconds long but like an instant at the same time. There were 2~4 drops of water. Then i started to come back to my senses and felt my eyes slightly sore. Then it got to the face and i felt like the noice was drowned out slightly. Then it got to the forest, and i had regained my sense of time fully. Then i stopped at the buildings because my head started to feel irritated, as if i was starting to get a headache. And not to mention that my eyes were sore, as if i didnt blink for a while.","In the center, In the periphery, All over the screen, It depended on what i saw. The landscapes would be at the center, but the shapes would be on one side of the screen or the other. Sometimes at the top or bottom. Then the lines would be scattered at the edges. I only saw one face but it was pretty wide and it went from the center to the left of my screen (i held my phone sideways)"

On occasion, some rays of light would extend from it (between four and six) and would sometimes rotate.  Then, I saw a pentagon and, eventually, it seemed as though I was seeing some large, swirling shapes (like you'd see in simulations of galaxy movements).  At some point, I noticed that, while red was still the predominant color, I was getting some blue, green, and yellow, as well, a sort of static (as you'd see on an older television) made up of red, blue, yellow, and green, and the black had pretty much vanished.  A couple times, I saw what looked like eyes and, maybe, a human or primate face (very vague, almost indistinguishable features, though) which would open its mouth, but these lasted for a brief moment, before they would swirl in that same galaxy-movement way as most of the other shapes.

When it first started, it was very uncomfortable to look at, but for the first few seconds I saw a flickering red and black screen with an afterimage of bluegreen with each flicker. After those first few seconds, it was like the red tinged a little darker, and I could see three or four bright red lines running through it. I kept blinking a lot because of the discomfort, which was messing up the illusion. After a minute or so, it was less uncomfortable so I was able to keep my eyes open for a few seconds at a time, and I started seeing a kind of swirling pattern in the bluegreen, and the bluegreen coloration started getting easier to see. I started being able to force my eyes to stay open more normally, and the swirling pattern began to get more intense, and eventually I could no longer perceive the screen itself flickering at all, it was just a solid red screen with a blinking, swirling pattern in it that ""reset"" with each blink. By reset, I mean the vortex would change direction, the pattern would change(from a fan blade appearance to swirling lines and back, mostly), it would flicker more or less frequently, etc. Because I could no longer perceive the screen flickering, it was a lot easier to relax and sit back and let the illusion flow because it wasn't bothering my eyes so much. Nothing really seemed to be changing for a minute or so, just the same swirling pattern that reset any time I blinked. If I held my eyes open, all that would happen was the whole screen filled with a lightly flickering bluegreen color that was swirling slightly. I was about to give up and come to the survey when I started seeing bright red and blue green edges surrounding the outside of the screen, like a glitch affect you would see in a movie or video game. So I settled in to see what else would happen. Very quickly after that, I started to see wavy bluegreen lines around my vision that kind of gave the illusion of things in my peripherals stretching and glitching out, but it was a very mild affect that didn't have much reality to it; it would clear as soon as I blinked or even just moved my eyes slightly. However, within a minute or two tha vortex started stretching out beyond the screen(which still had a glitchy kind of haze around the edges) and it started combining its edges with the wavy lines I was seeing. That's when it started to get trippy, because NOTHING was clearing up when I blinked anymore. It still kind of reset, but it didn't go away. I could shift my eyes around the area of the screen, and the affect was still there. Everything within my field of vision was pulsing and being stretched into this illusory vortex. The audio I could hear even started habing this sort of pulsating affect where it lowered in pitch in pulses within the visual. Over the next minute or so it just kept getting more ""solid"" and real-looking, until finally it was ramping up my anxiety (I am diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder that I do take meds for) and I finally for the first time looked completely away from the screen and up at the ceiling, which instantly got rid of the outside-the-screen illusion, but in my peripherals I could still see a slight vortex and the bluegreen affect in the TV screen. While looking away, I blinked a few times and looked back. The illusion had backtracked to where there was a pulsating bluegreen vortex maintained within the screen with bright red lines running through it. The idea of continuing gave me anxiety, so I decided to stop and complete the survey. I'm not sure exactly how long it was; I think it was less than ten minutes but I'm not positive. I forgot to check the time when I started watching it.","A few seconds, 1-2 minutes, I could see bluegreen mixed into the black immediately, simple lines after a few seconds, then a vortex pattern after about a minute",Constantly,"Very vivid, almost real, or popping out of the screen, The longer I watched, the more intense and real it seemed","Constant, morphing from one image to the next, Once I could perceive the bluegreen vortex, it never went away, though it ""reset"" every blink: changing shape, direction, size, etc","Grestly increased anxiety, but never lost my sense of time or space or anything else like that.",,"All over the screen, Whole screen, eventually growing outside it"

I wanted to enjoy this and perhaps this actually prevented me from experiencing more intense feelings. I saw geometry, light, and complex patterns that looked like fabrics of geometry and colors and shapes weaving into each other. In my head, I tried to steer my thoughts to process some of the feelings about the end of a romantic relationship I am trying to let go of. I kept trying to see her, talk to her, somehow, but it didn't really manifest in any way. I think it actually helped me realize that it was time to let go. I had smoked & vaporized some cannabis flower and had a bit of beer before as well. I was really nervous before going in as I have tried psychedelics before. This experience was not as intense, but it had some elements that resonated in a similar way. I had a few times where the images did appear to break free of the screen and move towards me. I also felt like I was moving towards the screen at points. Sometimes I would close my eyes and see the wildest patterns, which I found interesting as well but I did not focus on as much because I wanted to recall the experience of looking at the screen. I didn't really get much out of the white noise, though it did perhaps make me focus better. Sometimes I would want to follow a pattern or thought further, but out of fear or carefulness I would stay put.

I guess I mostly saw blurry images because my eyes were tired from the flicker and kept unfocussing, even though mentally I was very focused. The sun began drawing patterns overlapping with the »background patterns« I was experiencing continuously. Sometimes those patterns drawn by the sun were letters, the clearest one was an uppercase N. The most fun one that kept reoccurring was a swirl. The background patterns went from straight lines to spiderwebs to emerging and moving shapes that were sometimes organic and sometimes really geometric.

Amazing!","It started with a frequent red spot (with sometimes a white dot in the middle) that moved with my vision. I also saw fractals much of the time, but they were behind the red: they were grey and white, and sometimes even purple(ish). The white/grey ring around the center red dot reminds me of what it looks like when I have an optical migraine (those are not a bad experience for me). That red dot morphed into lots of things for me though. I saw a dragon breathing fire and eating itself. I saw what looked like a worm hole into another universe or place of some sort, I saw what looked like a black hole and lots of the time I saw that looked like the universe growing and collapsing on itself: suns imploding and then exploding, creating white dwarfs and black holes. The whole thing was always in motion (much of the time the bottom was spinning or bending one direction while the top was going the other way (""top"" and ""bottom"" are bad descriptors here, because it wasn't the top of the screen per se, it was the top of what I was seeing and that could tilt, tip, move spin and bend in any direction at any time). The universe is what I saw most. Also, I found it amazing that much of the time I could see white stars behind the red and black screen - those stars actually grew out from the screen and I could see them well beyond the edges of my computer screen while I was watching! The stars were like watching the milky way on a starry night from up in the mountains, only they turn and spin and rotate the whole time (whereas normal stars appear to hold steady as I watch them). The white stars would sometimes turn into circles (that I can only describe as looking like animations I've seen of red blood cells), then I'd be back to seeing the starts and the expanse of the universe. Also, at one point, the computer screen looked like it bent around my visual field as if I had a curved monitor (I don't). That lasted for some time, and was very interesting! There is an article titled ""Deep Dive into Curved Displays"" on the Samsung website if you want to see what it looked like to me: if you look in that article for the part labeled ""Shift in liquid crystals alignment when flat LCD panel is bent"" and then look for the curved panel with the image of the bridge on it, that shows how the screen looked bent to me: the right and left sides became distorted - almost like the screen was wrapping around my head. I also saw tornadoes (of fire) and what looked like red blood platelets going into and then exploding from a blood vessel (the ""platelets"" were all very patterned looking, not like actual blood spattering). The most real thing I saw was an eye, which appeared in the middle of the screen for a short time (30 seconds maybe); it definitely belonged to a rabbit, then I saw about half of the rabbits face for a short while. I also had some lingering ""ghosting"" effect where I could still see white or silver looking remnants of what I'd been seeing before I turned it off; that wasn't bothersome or anything, just figured I'd note it. I found that what I saw changed if I was closer or further from the screen as well (most of the time I was about 12-18"" away). What I saw also changed and morphed to the music when I watched it with Pink Floyd, Dark Side of the Moon (I switched to music after 10 minutes watching it with white noise). It would slow down if the music slowed down and speed up when the music went faster.  I preferred it with the music, and I found watching it very enjoyable (although the red was a bit distracting, I got past that pretty fast). I did hear weird sounds in the white noise that I can't really describe now except to say that it almost sounded like someone talking indistinctly (I can frequently hear sounds like I am listening to a radio playing in the background when I have a loud fan running at night, and that was a bit similar to what I heard). I think it would be interesting to see this in different colors (or maybe have it rotate through colors that change), if that's possible?

All of the descriptions above were relevant. The only other vivid colors I saw were yellow and orange. The screen kept feeling like it was growing and sometimes it felt like I was enveloped by the red and black world.

When I was more relaxed and focused, I first saw insects and other animals emerge. Then images of buildings like skyscrapers and a lighthouse, bridges, and rooms. I never experienced them as fully separate from the red and black. They had non-red colors but I don't recall whether they were as vivid as the red. Many times I had the sensation of zooming through the imagery; such as between the buildings, under the bridges, or up the lighthouse and into a duct in a room.

After a while, I stopped seeing vivid imagery, perhaps from the stress of sitting 15 minutes watching a screen flicker. Instead of giving up on trying to see god or whatever, I decided to modify the code. I changed the flicker from 66.67ms to 50ms, and the patterns, color, and imagery became much more vivid. I didn't want to break my sensory cortex, so I stopped after a few minutes.

They would become more vivid the longer I didn't blink, but sometimes they would return immediately, other times they would need a few seconds. It was also interesting viewing with one eye at a time, I didn't do this for very long, but each time I say patterns more and a couple weak, outlined shapes. But with both eyes I saw a huge variety. Mostly shapes of animals (larger animals like bulls or large cat animals, a few times a snake, especially a giant head of one), a humanoid lion the looked like it was roaring, dragons where often seen, sometimes just the head other times with their necks and only a couple times with their whole bodies. Sometimes I would see humans. Sometimes clouds or a field or branches. The scenery was never strong until the end. But what I found most interesting was the style of the visions. Most were only outlines, white, blue, black, and electric purple (literally looked like little bolts of purple electricity that formed the outlines) were the most common, and the red was the base color of the image. But sometimes it was very simple, other times very well defined and like a style of anime art, it looked hand drawn, but very well drawn. The level of detail and shading effects would sometimes be very well defined and appear to be appropriately colored, but only for a brief second before changing again. Some of the coolest were when the outlines of the images were in rainbow, almost holographic looking. This only happened two different times, maybe lasting for 30 seconds to a minute each. It was hard to tell how much time passed. But the shapes and images kept changing with the rainbow outline too. And the fill color was almost rainbow, but more dull than the outline. It's hard to describe how the art changed throughout, but at the very end, it flickered between vivid real life like images, like not seeing the red and black at all, except for faintly in the periphery, and in the majority of the center of my vision I saw a hospital, looked like the hallway with some doctors and nurses walking down it, and I could see a patient being carted into or out of a room, then it changed to a man in a blue outfit and hat, the had climbed a short ladder to a porch, I guess, to drop off a six pack of glass milk bottles like what used to be done, what, before the 80s? And there was a third rea life scene that I can't remember now. But these felt almost more like I was starting to dream with my eyes open. They stopped suddenly because the white noise stopped. It felt like five minutes had passed at the most, so I kept watching for a couple minutes in case the player stopped early and tried to get the super vivid images to come back. Didn't have any luck, but I only waited for another two minutes roughly, and this didn't have any of the loud white noise, just a fan in the background. I also thought it might be good to note that I put my laptop into tablet mode for this so I could have it right in my face and fill my field of view. But I also tried pulling it back about 20 inches, so it still filled most of my vision, but not entirely. This did create different effects, somewhat. And after a while, my vision felt pulled into the screen and it seemed to fill my entire field of view again. And the whole screen sometimes felt like it was jumping side to side rapidly, and somewhat up and down. When that started, I brought it closer to my face again and it stopped. But it was very interesting and cool, I thought I should describe the man a little more, e was grinning with short brown hair, looked to be in a suit, and he kind of pointed in one direction. And later it was either him or another man that threw a baseball of something, and when that happened the image became the ball as it grew closer from being thrown to my face, and then morphed into something else. Also saw what I would describe as a shaman, with a  cow head skull with horns on his head, a poncho, and a staff. He appeared more than once in different orientations. That's about all I can remember and differentiate from the more random shapes, blurs, and flashes.",A few seconds,Constantly,"Weak, faint, or insubstantial, Clear, but not vivid, Clear and moderately vivid, Clear, vivid, and/or bright, Very vivid, almost real, or popping out of the screen","Brief moment or flash, 1-2 seconds, Constant, morphing from one image to the next","Became relaxed or sleepy, As if in a dreamlike state, Lost a sense of time, Lost a sense of space","I definitely felt more relaxed through it after a minute or two. When I head the white noise by itself, it sounded loud and uncomfortable, but with the flickering it was peaceful and welcome. Then I lost track of time completely. It went by much faster than I expected, so the  images may have lasted longer than it felt too. And when I had the screen farther from my face and then felt absorbed into the light, it seemed like the space around me became inconsequential and unbound. Like the space I had created between me and the screen no longer existed, I was in the ever changing, flickering world. At the end it felt very dreamlike with how vivid the images became, and I almost wondered if I was falling asleep, but then I'd blink my eyes and they had been fully open. I wanted that feeling to last longer and be even stronger, but I felt much more taken out of it once the white noise stopped. Next time I'll have a longer loop play. And this would be very interesting with marijuana, which the couple times I have taken an edible of it, my visual prowess was enhanced to create extremely powerful and vivid and complex images and thoughts. Multiple at the same time. So I will probably do this again while under the influence in the future.  . ","In the center, All over the screen"

If I used any mental energy whatsoever other than ""I'm going to watch these gears spin until they morph into the towering sky scrapers that pop out of comic books and then trees rushing around the screen like bullet trains"", then I could see something a little more specific and *mildly* less chaotic, like a car treading up the steps of a pyramid or a cartoon monkey building a boat.

These were not simple elementary school shapes. They formed warping tessellations, they were both two- and three-dimensional, and they were moving exceedingly fast. These patterns often formed whirlpools that could spin in either direction. Eventually I began to get glimpses of more vivid images, such as tree lines, a sea of clouds viewed from above, a distant castle, a skyline, a nice park scene, and once, a Jupiter-like planet with a far more artistic surface. Frustratingly, however, these images were so fleeting as to be nearly unnoticeable, and only appeared in the black screen. About halfway through at best estimate, there was a noticeable change in what I saw. The geometric patterns became blurry, as if I had zoomed in on them, and seemed more like lighting effects flashing across the screen. Gone were the sharp tessellations and I could not bring them back. I could no longer see scenery, except for a tree-lined river towards the very end. Instead, I saw faces, some blurry, some sharp in detail. Interestingly, I only saw faces in the red screen, as if the color of the Ganzflicker determined what I saw. The faces only appeared for a split second compared to the earlier images, yet seemed easier to perceive. I could hold on to images in the black for a few or several flickers before they faded. The faces, on the other hand seemed to only appear in one flicker. Whereas most of the black images appeared to be the same size, the faces could be any size and seemed to appear in a far greater variety of locations on the screen. There was no correlation between how big the faces were and how blurry they were. Most of them did not appear to be any face I'd seen before. A few were recognizable types of people, such as a nun or a fancy looking man. A further few could have been people I'd seen before. Most of these looked like painted portraits of scientists and 18th century historical figures. I could even imagine them wearing colored business suits of the period, though I didn't actually see such colors. The red varied in lightness, almost to the point of white-pink.

After a bit the branches went away and turned into bright red ""lasers"" which swung around the image occasionally coming directly at me, which hurt my eyes as if I had a laser pointer shined in them, though not very powerfully. 

These lasers eventually became entire fans of light sweeping around, and then it felt as if the screen began to expand, and I stopped seeing the edge of my screen, my entire sight filling up with a massive red triangle, made of small blocks. This triangle moved up and down until it broke into two smaller triangles, one above the other, these continued to move up and down, colliding with one another, black chevrons appearing between them. 

I felt like my eyes were closed, but I could still see all this, the triangles violently shifting, breaking into a circle of white, surrounded by a cyan halo. It was around then the white noise stopped, and the circle turned into a heart, a black outline around a red and white circle.

Only now, typing this now do I realize that the main four colors were red, black, grey, and white only two of which were actually there. The white and grey just felt so natural I never assumed anything. The cyan however, while it was brief it stood out, and felt unnatural.

After some time, I kept seeing things, even with the white noise gone, I felt almost as if I was barely conscious, and I  had to make a massive effort to rip myself from looking, it just felt wrong, it felt like I was giving up something pulling myself away.

It could just be placebo, that I am working myself up after this, but all while answering this I have been shaking almost uncontrollably, and it has made typing a bit harder because I miss the keys and need to go back.

Now the shaking has stopped, and I just feel lightheaded, and my lips are numb, this may be unrelated though as I have anemia and low blood pressure so this happens quite often, and this is not nearly as intense as it gets, I don't feel like I am actually  losing consciousness which happens sometimes.

Started in the abstract. I remember one there was an eye and a river pouring out of the pupil in a very pop art fashion. These eyes would start getting more and more realistic to the point of realism. The eyes ranged from just a few seconds of a static image to blinking. whole faces started to appear then, wish a focus on the eyes, nose and mouth. These faces were moving, they would just flash on for about one to two seconds. They appeared at different angles and different sizes. I didn't recognize any of these faces. They were just of men and woman. Theres eyes were really peircing. They didn't have any expression on their faces as they appeared all over the screen.

","The first ~10 min was w/white noise, which seemed to affect my perception of environment more than it did the visualization. The first ~5 min I didn’t really settle in too well (more a consequence of viewing environment), and I bounced between focused and unfocused vision. That period was dominated by perception of rapidly shifting light and color that wasn’t as much static patterns as it was a synchronous “scattering” of alternating light and color in variable motion across the screen according to which direction, and mode and interval of movement I chose to follow w/my eyes. Eventually, I began to see that motion as tick marks across the top of the screen and imagined I was looking to the edge of a roulette wheel from the shadows of the center, the white noise mimicking the sound of the wheel ticking, and the motion of the ticks began curving around me. When I began to relax my eyes, there was a perception of environment that I will describe as abstract, palpable—and somewhat unsettling, even when the imagery morphed. While the imagery was never clear, each “scene” seemed to have an overarching theme of an inferno that, though the thought of fire normally elicits visions of bright flames, it was always cloaked in darkness. Either I was at a midnight rave and saw strobed light that seemed to pulsate to the music’s beat and shadows of hands in the air briefly blocking the light, or I was stepping from cold, black space into the vaporous billows of the sun’s surface, or staring into the pit of a volcano at the roiling lava lake from the edge of the crater and dark night, trying to see the trees through dense smoke from a wildfire that turned day nearly to night, or trying to make out figures through a smoky haze smelling of gunpowder from freshly fired muskets and lit canons. I was always struggling to get a better view in dimly lit, partially obscured scenes; but then the experience turned more sentient than visual for me, and I felt I was being watched—even stalked, and almost hunted. I somewhat locked onto that feeling, and the more complex scenery became being lost in the shadows of a city at night, and though nobody else seemed to be out, between the flashing hues of black and red and sometimes blue, my eyes became stuck on a shadow protruding from the corner of the screen. If I stayed focused on that, it didn’t seem to change in my vision, but I felt as though somebody—or something—was lurking. If I let my eyes relax, the shadow became a dark figure that moved across screen and was suddenly much closer, causing me to feel the unease of being followed—possibly a Freudian metaphor for the internet and privacy, or lack thereof. It was during the periods of watching and being watched that the test seemed more sentient than visual for me. While having the white noise playing contributed to the overall “atmosphere” by integrating as musical beats, jetting gases, volcanic explosions, crackling fire, or firing weapons, it lent to a more ominous feeling when “being followed in the nighttime cityscape,;” but it didn’t seem to affect the visual imagery. Once the noise stopped, the “shadow who was following me” seemed to move across the screen more frequently in the silence; but sentience gradually gave way to visualization. I don’t know if there was a correlation between the shadow’s frequency and white noise/silence, if my perception changed as I began to focus my vision in the last few minutes, or if there was, indeed, a shadow moving across screen w/greater frequency then…or? Once maximum focus was achieved, I was back in the hub of the roulette wheel fixed, as it spun, moving fractals with my mind—east to west, up to down, radiating, pulsating—until I saw bullseyes radiating to pinpricks with each pulse away from me, at which point I compared the experience to lying in a dark room w/my eyes closed while listening to binaural beats at a specific frequency, at which point I realized boredom. That experience, in comparison to this test, was like comparing a dmt trip (I’ve never consumed dmt, just the alleged natural release) to being stoned. I experienced a lasting clarity of mind and vivid imagery, and perceiving a feeling of transcendence and inner peace with that experience. For the most part, I’m coming away from this test feeling unsure to mostly indifferent; hence, boredom setting in. Good luck—hope this helps!","They began to emerge immediately, 5-7 minutes, Multi-directional, synchronouspatterns of light and color that I could consciously manipulate were visualized immediately; the complex, abstract immersive environments changed a few times and seemed to occur when I let my eyes completely relax.",Frequently,See description of my experience below. ,"Constant, morphing from one image to the next, Constantly morphing abstract complex imagery, with a somewhat pervasive sense of environment with constant motion that persisted for however long I let my eyes relax; while focused, persistent shifting patterns of light and color. ","Aware of time and space, yet in a state of superposition as I sensed alternate realities at the same time. Compare to being tethered to yourself in an out-of-body experience (because everyone knows exactly how that feels, right?!), or lucid dreaming. ","This is all coming across as, “Outer fringes space oddity,” I’m realizing…gotta go with what’s real, though! Best descriptive I can do at this point is, “Far, far away and right here in the multiverse, stuck with each foot in a different dimension, and the rest of me straddling the event horizon.” Whatever that means.

Sometimes the sphere would have 2 stripes, and would resemble a neutron star as depicted in the game, Elite: Dangerous. This is occasionally morphed into a ""Doctor Who"" opening credits like tunnel, with occasional cross hatch patterns that resemble morphing plaid. The plaid pattern would morph into dozens of evenly spaced buzz saw like stars, (These were very detailed down to the saw tooth edges) and then into peacock eyes. At several points curved lines would appear and sometimes overlap and straighten to form a triangle and then appear 3 dimensional like a pyramid. Sometimes these lines would curve again and resemble rotating DNA stands.

","The feeling I got, may have been self imposed. Most of my life I have experienced various phenomena, most relevant here are sleep paralysis, hypnogogic hallucinations, and visual snow. My first encounter with sleep paralysis turned me into a skeptic and an amateur brain science nerd. I have reviewed a lot of the research behind this stuff, and I love it, but I have also delved into meditation and experimented with trying to reach altered mental states as well. Some of the fruit of that work, is that I have at least a few times, managed to trigger hypnogogic hallucinations while awake, and standing up. I may have contaminated your results a bit, as I used those techniques here, to test and see if the experience was at all enhanced. (I never use binaural beats for meditative purposes because of the quackery involved with that, however upon reading the theory behind this research, I was reminded of the neurology behind why we hear binaural beats and decided to throw that in the background on a hunch.) While the hallucinations were present, they were actually less vivid than those experiences, where the hallucinations were indistinguishable from reality, except that they were absurd. However like with those experiences, the imagery was random and uncontrollable. Given the patterns I saw today, I would not rule out the potential for them to be interference patterns from the refresh rate of the display, however the patterns appeared to move with my eyes, and not maintain lock to any part of the displays within the headset. Also, what is most interesting to me, is that all of these images, were the imagery I see during migraine but enhanced. The spinning spiral, and the moving patterns, were all very reminiscent of that. Moreso, I have a condition (I would hardly call it that, it's non-debilitating for the most part, except it messes with my eyes while driving at night) called visual snow. There is very little research into this phenomena, but I had found and had a brief correspondence with James T. Fulton, Director of Research, at Neural Concepts in Newport Beach, Ca. who seemed to think, based on his research there, that visual snow is related to edema localized to the anterior horn of the left or right lateral ventricle. The condition manifests for me as a consistent, and rapid shifting grain, that resembles and behaves like fine grain television static over my entire field of vision, regardless of if my eyes are open or closed, that is distinguishable from blue field entopic effect, phosphenes, and migraine phenomena (which appear to be on the same ""layer"" of my vision, but geometric and non-random like the snow. This is hard to describe). Occasionally the snow will appear to manifest random ""imagery"" sometimes just shapes, and sometimes just random streaks across my vision, though these are both rare, and in my meditation I had noticed that the vivid imagery seems to come about from changes in this ""static field"". I lack the scientific resources to study this under any sort of control, so it is impossible for me to really determine how the snow is related, whether the snow is connected to the same parts of the brain that create hallucinations, or if the random patterns in the snow, is seeding hallucinations via pareidolia. I bring it up, because that too seemed to play a part in what I was seeing here, but all enhanced. I would really like to see some of this stuff taken into account with this research as it could lead to some better understandings all around.

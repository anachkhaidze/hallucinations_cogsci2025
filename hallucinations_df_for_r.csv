Then, with the waterfall image, i forgot i was where i was and felt as if i was levitated above the underwater waterfall.","At first, I was normal. The white noice was meh, and i didnt really care- i started getting bored. Then I started to experience change in what i was seeing, so i got slightly curious, but felt if i tried to look at it directly, it might dissappear. So i didnt focus on the slight changes. Then, as the noise kept going, the images kept changing, and i started to find it harder and harder to stay concentrated. It was around then that i started to lose my sense of time. Have you ever felt like a second was longer than 5, or a minute shorter than 30seconds? Thats how i felt. Then it got to the waterfall image, and i fully lost myself of that one. It was as if i didnt have any other thought on my mind, except for the sight of that waterfall. And when i heard the drops of water, the sound of the impact felt several seconds long but like an instant at the same time. There were 2~4 drops of water. Then i started to come back to my senses and felt my eyes slightly sore. Then it got to the face and i felt like the noice was drowned out slightly. Then it got to the forest, and i had regained my sense of time fully. Then i stopped at the buildings because my head started to feel irritated, as if i was starting to get a headache. And not to mention that my eyes were sore, as if i didnt blink for a while.","In the center, In the periphery, All over the screen, It depended on what i saw.

This experience was more relaxed. I didn't feel too bothered by the illusions. It never occurred to me that I could be trapped and I would hate this existence if it lasted forever.

I'd even say it is in the high end of the Beta range, close to a Gamma wave.  As soon as the flickering light began my first change in consciousness was missing my old CRT monitor.  The LCD can't strobe the entire screen as evenly and intensely as those old tube monitors.  But I decided to make the most of what I have got, so I lightly closed my eyes and leaned back a little in my chair.  I intentionally relaxed and turned off the usual flow of words in my mind.  Entering a meditative state and breathing deeply, I began to see hallucinatory patterns right away.  They shifted to a pattern, a character, a scene, and back to flickering light.  I thought, ""this is fun! I wonder how long I have been using it?"" So I opened my eyes to check the time.  Looked like about 2 minutes.  Easy to shift out of the Ganzflicker hallucinations and back to full waking consciousness.  How long until I need to get ready for work?  Time noted, I went back into the Ganzflicker.  Felt relaxed but mentally aroused by the experience.  Overall it was nice, but I was eventually longing for greater user-control.  I would enjoy very much the ability to adjust the speed and color of the flashing.  Best if these adjustments are in very fine increments, and the hotkeys for this are live during the experience.  I believe this would allow the user to fine-tune the Ganzflicker for maximum effect.  I'd suggest using directional arrows (up = faster, left = color shift toward red) - that way the user can rest one hand on these familiar arrows and steer the experience without much mental overhead. Thanks for sharing your research with me.

When I head the white noise by itself, it sounded loud and uncomfortable, but with the flickering it was peaceful and welcome. Then I lost track of time completely. It went by much faster than I expected, so the  images may have lasted longer than it felt too. And when I had the screen farther from my face and then felt absorbed into the light, it seemed like the space around me became inconsequential and unbound. Like the space I had created between me and the screen no longer existed, I was in the ever changing, flickering world. At the end it felt very dreamlike with how vivid the images became, and I almost wondered if I was falling asleep, but then I'd blink my eyes and they had been fully open. I wanted that feeling to last longer and be even stronger, but I felt much more taken out of it once the white noise stopped. Next time I'll have a longer loop play. And this would be very interesting with marijuana, which the couple times I have taken an edible of it, my visual prowess was enhanced to create extremely powerful and vivid and complex images and thoughts. Multiple at the same time. So I will probably do this again while under the influence in the future.  .

As I watched the flicker and listened to the static, it felt almost as though I was straining to see a threatening shape at night, and listen for its movements, but there was so much noise (as opposed to signal) that I couldn't make it out, and that if I didn't manage to I was in danger. I noticed afterwards that I was sweating slightly, and that my eyes were dry from holding them open too wide and too long. 

also, it's hard to explain, but at times I felt like the flickering on the screen was growing out of my computer and not just enveloping my vision, but becoming my vision, with no clear boundary between what I was seeing and what I was looking at. This was strongly coupled with losing my sense of time, and when the static stopped playing I was quite surprised that ten minutes had already gone by.

Incidentally, it is very odd to me to imagine anything approximating a dreamlike or sleepy reaction to the experience.

","The feeling I got, may have been self imposed. Most of my life I have experienced various phenomena, most relevant here are sleep paralysis, hypnogogic hallucinations, and visual snow. My first encounter with sleep paralysis turned me into a skeptic and an amateur brain science nerd. I have reviewed a lot of the research behind this stuff, and I love it, but I have also delved into meditation and experimented with trying to reach altered mental states as well. Some of the fruit of that work, is that I have at least a few times, managed to trigger hypnogogic hallucinations while awake, and standing up. I may have contaminated your results a bit, as I used those techniques here, to test and see if the experience was at all enhanced. (I never use binaural beats for meditative purposes because of the quackery involved with that, however upon reading the theory behind this research, I was reminded of the neurology behind why we hear binaural beats and decided to throw that in the background on a hunch.) While the hallucinations were present, they were actually less vivid than those experiences, where the hallucinations were indistinguishable from reality, except that they were absurd. However like with those experiences, the imagery was random and uncontrollable. Given the patterns I saw today, I would not rule out the potential for them to be interference patterns from the refresh rate of the display, however the patterns appeared to move with my eyes, and not maintain lock to any part of the displays within the headset. Also, what is most interesting to me, is that all of these images, were the imagery I see during migraine but enhanced. The spinning spiral, and the moving patterns, were all very reminiscent of that. Moreso, I have a condition (I would hardly call it that, it's non-debilitating for the most part, except it messes with my eyes while driving at night) called visual snow. There is very little research into this phenomena, but I had found and had a brief correspondence with James T. Fulton, Director of Research, at Neural Concepts in Newport Beach, Ca. who seemed to think, based on his research there, that visual snow is related to edema localized to the anterior horn of the left or right lateral ventricle. The condition manifests for me as a consistent, and rapid shifting grain, that resembles and behaves like fine grain television static over my entire field of vision, regardless of if my eyes are open or closed, that is distinguishable from blue field entopic effect, phosphenes, and migraine phenomena (which appear to be on the same ""layer"" of my vision, but geometric and non-random like the snow. This is hard to describe). Occasionally the snow will appear to manifest random ""imagery"" sometimes just shapes, and sometimes just random streaks across my vision, though these are both rare, and in my meditation I had noticed that the vivid imagery seems to come about from changes in this ""static field"". I lack the scientific resources to study this under any sort of control, so it is impossible for me to really determine how the snow is related, whether the snow is connected to the same parts of the brain that create hallucinations, or if the random patterns in the snow, is seeding hallucinations via pareidolia. I bring it up, because that too seemed to play a part in what I was seeing here, but all enhanced. I would really like to see some of this stuff taken into account with this research as it could lead to some better understandings all around.
